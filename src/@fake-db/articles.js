      "title": "The Selling of Attention Deficit Disorder",
      "content": "\n\n\n\nAfter more than 50 years leading the fight to legitimize attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, Keith Conners could be celebrating.         \n\n \nSeverely hyperactive and impulsive children, once shunned as bad seeds, are now recognized as having a real neurological problem. Doctors and parents have largely accepted drugs like Adderall and Concerta to temper the traits of classic A.D.H.D., helping youngsters succeed in school and beyond.        \nBut Dr. Conners did not feel triumphant this fall as he addressed a group of fellow A.D.H.D. specialists in Washington. He noted that recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that the diagnosis had been made in 15 percent of high school-age children, and that the number of children on medication for the disorder had soared to 3.5 million from 600,000 in 1990. He questioned the rising rates of diagnosis and called them â€œa national disaster of dangerous proportions.â€        \nâ€œThe numbers make it look like an epidemic. Well, it's not. It's preposterous,â€ Dr. Conners, a psychologist and professor emeritus at Duke University, said in a subsequent interview. â€œThis is a concoction to justify the giving out of medication at unprecedented and unjustifiable levels.â€                \nThe rise of A.D.H.D. diagnoses and prescriptions for stimulants over the years coincided with a remarkably successful two-decade campaign by pharmaceutical companies to publicize the syndrome and promote the pills to doctors, educators and parents. With the children's market booming, the industry is now employing similar marketing techniques as it focuses on adult A.D.H.D., which could become even more profitable.        \nFew dispute that classic A.D.H.D., historically estimated to affect 5 percent of children, is a legitimate disability that impedes success at school, work and personal life. Medication often assuages the severe impulsiveness and inability to concentrate, allowing a person's underlying drive and intelligence to emerge.        \nBut even some of the field's longtime advocates say the zeal to find and treat every A.D.H.D. child has led to too many people with scant symptoms receiving the diagnosis and medication. The disorder is now the second most frequent long-term diagnosis made in children, narrowly trailing asthma, according to a New York Times analysis of C.D.C. data.        \nBehind that growth has been drug company marketing that has stretched the image of classic A.D.H.D. to include relatively normal behavior like carelessness and impatience, and has often overstated the pills' benefits. Advertising on television and in popular magazines like People and Good Housekeeping has cast common childhood forgetfulness and poor grades as grounds for medication that, among other benefits, can result in â€œschoolwork that matches his intelligenceâ€ and ease family tension.        \nA 2002 ad for Adderall showed a mother playing with her son and saying, â€œThanks for taking out the garbage.â€        \nThe Food and Drug Administration has cited every major A.D.H.D. drug – stimulants like Adderall, Concerta, Focalin and Vyvanse, and nonstimulants like Intuniv and Strattera – for false and misleading advertising since 2000, some multiple times.        \nSources of information that would seem neutral also delivered messages from the pharmaceutical industry. Doctors paid by drug companies have published research and delivered presentations that encourage physicians to make diagnoses more often that discredit growing concerns about overdiagnosis.        \nMany doctors have portrayed the medications as benign – â€œsafer than aspirin,â€ some say – even though they can have significant side effects and are regulated in the same class as morphine and oxycodone because of their potential for abuse and addiction. Patient advocacy groups tried to get the government to loosen regulation of stimulants while having sizable portions of their operating budgets covered by pharmaceutical interests.                \nCompanies even try to speak to youngsters directly. Shire – the longtime market leader, with several A.D.H.D. medications including Adderall – recently subsidized 50,000 copies of a comic book that tries to demystify the disorder and uses superheroes to tell children, â€œMedicines may make it easier to pay attention and control your behavior!â€        \nProfits for the A.D.H.D. drug industry have soared. Sales of stimulant medication in 2012 were nearly $9 billion, more than five times the $1.7 billion a decade before, according to the data company IMS Health.        \nEven Roger Griggs, the pharmaceutical executive who introduced Adderall in 1994, said he strongly opposes marketing stimulants to the general public because of their dangers. He calls them â€œnuclear bombs,â€ warranted only under extreme circumstances and when carefully overseen by a physician.        \nPsychiatric breakdown and suicidal thoughts are the most rare and extreme results of stimulant addiction, but those horror stories are far outnumbered by people who, seeking to study or work longer hours, cannot sleep for days, lose their appetite or hallucinate. More can simply become habituated to the pills and feel they cannot cope without them.        \nTom Casola, the Shire vice president who oversees the A.D.H.D. division, said in an interview that the company aims to provide effective treatment for those with the disorder, and that ultimately doctors were responsible for proper evaluations and prescriptions. He added that he understood some of the concerns voiced by the Food and Drug Administration and others about aggressive ads, and said that materials that run afoul of guidelines are replaced.        \nâ€œShire – and I think the vast majority of pharmaceutical companies – intend to market in a way that's responsible and in a way that is compliant with the regulations,â€ Mr. Casola said. â€œAgain, I like to think we come at it from a higher order. We are dealing with patients' health.â€        \nA spokesman for Janssen Pharmaceuticals, which makes Concerta, said in an email, â€œOver the years, we worked with clinicians, parents and advocacy groups to help educate health care practitioners and caregivers about diagnosis and treatment of A.D.H.D., including safe and effective use of medication.â€        \nNow targeting adults, Shire and two patient advocacy groups have recruited celebrities like the Maroon 5 musician Adam Levine for their marketing campaign,  â€œIt's Your A.D.H.D. â€“ Own It.â€ Online quizzes sponsored by drug companies are designed to encourage people to pursue treatment. A medical education video sponsored by Shire portrays a physician making a diagnosis of the disorder in an adult in a six-minute conversation, after which the doctor recommends medication.        \nLike most psychiatric conditions, A.D.H.D. has no definitive test, and most experts in the field agree that its symptoms are open to interpretation by patients, parents and doctors. The American Psychiatric Association, which receives significant financing from drug companies, has gradually loosened the official criteria for the disorder to include common childhood behavior like â€œmakes careless mistakesâ€ or â€œoften has difficulty waiting his or her turn.â€        \nThe idea that a pill might ease troubles and tension has proved seductive to worried parents, rushed doctors and others.        \nâ€œPharma pushed as far as they could, but you can't just blame the virus,â€ said Dr. Lawrence Diller, a behavioral pediatrician in Walnut Creek, Calif. â€œYou have to have a susceptible host for the epidemic to take hold. There's something they know about us that they utilize and exploit.â€        Selling to Doctors         \nModern marketing of stimulants began with the name Adderall itself. Mr. Griggs bought a small pharmaceutical company that produced a weight-loss pill named Obetrol. Suspecting that it might treat a relatively unappreciated condition then called attention deficit disorder, and found in about 3 to 5 percent of children, he took â€œA.D.D.â€ and fiddled with snappy suffixes. He cast a word with the widest net.        \nAll.        \nFor A.D.D.        \nA.D.D. for All.        \nAdderall.        \nâ€œIt was meant to be kind of an inclusive thing,â€ Mr. Griggs recalled.                \nAdderall quickly established itself as a competitor of the field's most popular drug, Ritalin. Shire, realizing the drug's potential, bought Mr. Griggs's company for $186 million and spent millions more to market the pill to doctors. After all, patients can buy only what their physicians buy into.        \nAs is typical among pharmaceutical companies, Shire gathered hundreds of doctors at meetings at which a physician paid by the company explained a new drug's value.        \nSuch a meeting was held for Shire's long-acting version of Adderall, Adderall XR, in April 2002, and included a presentation that to many critics, exemplifies how questionable A.D.H.D. messages are delivered.        \nDr. William W. Dodson, a psychiatrist from Denver, stood before 70 doctors at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel and Spa in Pasadena, Calif., and clicked through slides that encouraged them to â€œeducate the patient on the lifelong nature of the disorder and the benefits of lifelong treatment.â€ But that assertion was not supported by science, as studies then and now have shown that perhaps half of A.D.H.D. children are not impaired as adults, and that little is known about the risks or efficacy of long-term medication use.        \nThe PowerPoint document, obtained by The Times, asserted that stimulants were not â€œdrugs of abuseâ€ because people who overdose â€œfeel nothingâ€ or â€œfeel bad.â€ Yet these drugs are classified by the government among the most abusable substances in medicine, largely because of their effects on concentration and mood. Overdosing can cause severe heart problems and psychotic behavior.        \nSlides described side effects of Adderall XR as â€œgenerally mild,â€ despite clinical trials showing notable rates of insomnia, significant appetite suppression and mood swings, as well as rare instances of hallucinations. Those side effects increase significantly among patients who take more pills than prescribed.        \nAnother slide warned that later in life, children with A.D.H.D. faced â€œjob failure or underemployment,â€ â€œfatal car wrecks,â€ â€œcriminal involvement,â€ â€œunwanted pregnancyâ€ and venereal diseases, but did not mention that studies had not assessed whether stimulants decreased those risks.                \nDr. Conners of Duke, in the audience that day, said the message was typical for such gatherings sponsored by pharmaceutical companies: Their drugs were harmless, and any traces of A.D.H.D. symptoms (which can be caused by a number of issues, including lack of sleep and family discord) should be treated with stimulant medication.        \nIn an interview last month, Dr. Dodson said he makes a new diagnosis in about 300 patients a year and, because he disagrees with studies showing that many A.D.H.D. children are not impaired as adults, always recommends their taking stimulants for the rest of their lives.        \nHe said that concern about abuse and side effects is â€œincredibly overblown,â€ and that his longtime work for drug companies does not influence his opinions. He said he received about $2,000 for the 2002 talk for Shire. He earned $45,500 in speaking fees from pharmaceutical companies in 2010 to 2011, according to ProPublica, which tracks such payments.        \nâ€œIf people want help, my job is to make sure they get it,â€ Dr. Dodson said. Regarding people concerned about prescribing physicians being paid by drug companies, he added: â€œThey like a good conspiracy theory. I don't let it slow me down.â€        \nMany of the scientific studies cited by drug company speakers involved Dr. Joseph Biederman, a prominent child psychiatrist at Harvard University and Massachusetts General Hospital. In 2008, a Senate investigation revealed that Dr. Biederman's research on many psychiatric conditions had been substantially financed by drug companies, including Shire. Those companies also paid him $1.6 million in speaking and consulting fees. He has denied that the payments influenced his research.        \nDr. Conners called Dr. Biederman â€œunequivocally the most published psychopharmacology maven for A.D.H.D.,â€ one who is well known for embracing stimulants and dismissing detractors. Findings from Dr. Biederman's dozens of studies on the disorder and specific brands of stimulants have filled the posters and pamphlets of pharmaceutical companies that financed the work.        \nThose findings typically delivered three messages: The disorder was underdiagnosed; stimulants were effective and safe; and unmedicated A.D.H.D. led to significant risks for academic failure, drug dependence, car accidents and brushes with the law.        \nDr. Biederman was frequently quoted about the benefits of stimulants in interviews and company news releases. In 2006, for example, he told Reuters Health, â€œIf a child is brilliant but is doing just O.K. in school, that child may need treatment, which would result in their performing brilliantly at school.â€        \nThis year, Dr. Biederman told the medical newsletter Medscape regarding medication for those with A.D.H.D., â€œDon't leave home without it.â€        \nDr. Biederman did not respond to requests for an interview.        \nMost of Dr. Biederman's critics said that they believed his primary motivation was always to help children with legitimate A.D.H.D. and that risks of untreated A.D.H.D. can be significant. What concerned them was how Dr. Biederman's high-profile and unwavering promotion of stimulants armed drug companies with the published science needed to create powerful advertisements – many of which cast medications as benign solutions to childhood behavior falling far short of legitimate A.D.H.D.        \nâ€œHe gave them credibility,â€ said Richard M. Scheffler, a professor of health economics and public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, who has written extensively on stimulants. â€œHe didn't have a balance. He became totally convinced that it's a good thing and can be more widely used.â€        Building a Message        \nDrug companies used the research of Dr. Biederman and others to create compelling messages for doctors. â€œAdderall XR Improves Academic Performance,â€ an ad in a psychiatry journal declared in 2003, leveraging two Biederman studies financed by Shire. A Concerta ad barely mentioned A.D.H.D., but said the medication would â€œallow your patients to experience life's successes every day.â€        \nSome studies had shown that stimulant medication helped some elementary school children with carefully evaluated A.D.H.D. to improve scores in reading and math tests, primarily by helping them concentrate. The concern, some doctors said, is that long-term, wider academic benefits have not been proved – and that ads suggesting they have can tempt doctors, perhaps subconsciously, to prescribe drugs with risks to healthy children merely to improve their grades or self-esteem.                \nâ€œThere are decades of research into how advertising influences doctors' prescribing practices,â€ said Dr. Aaron Kesselheim of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, who specializes in pharmaceutical ethics. â€œEven though they'll tell you that they're giving patients unbiased, evidence-based information, in fact they're more likely to tell you what the drug company told them, whether it's the benefits of the drugs or the risks of those drugs.â€        \nDrug company advertising also meant good business for medical journals â€“ the same journals that published papers supporting the use of the drugs. The most prominent publication in the field, The Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, went from no ads for A.D.H.D. medications from 1990 to 1993 to about 100 pages per year a decade later. Almost every full-page color ad was for an A.D.H.D. drug.        \nAs is legal and common in pharmaceutical marketing, stimulants' possible side effects like insomnia, irritability and psychotic episodes were printed in small type and dominated by other messages. One Adderall XR brochure included the recording of a man's voice reassuring doctors: â€œAmphetamines have been used medically for nearly 70 years. That's a legacy of safety you can count on.â€ He did not mention any side effects.        \nDrug companies used sales representatives to promote the drugs in person. Brian Lutz, a Shire salesman for Adderall XR from 2004 to 2009, said he met with 75 psychiatrists in his Oakland, Calif., territory at least every two weeks – about 30 to 40 times apiece annually – to show them posters and pamphlets that highlighted the medicine's benefits for grades and behavior.        \nIf a psychiatrist asked about issues like side effects or abuse, Mr. Lutz said, they were played down. He said he was told to acknowledge risks matter-of-factly for legal reasons, but to refer only to the small print in the package insert or offer Shire's phone number for more information.        \nâ€œIt was never like, ‘This is a serious side effect, you need to watch out for it,' â€ Mr. Lutz recalled. â€œYou wanted to give them more information because we're talking about kids here, you know? But it was all very positive.â€        \nA Shire spokeswoman said the company would not comment on any specific employee and added, â€œShire sales representatives are trained to deliver fair and balanced presentations that include information regarding the safety of our products.â€        \nMr. Lutz, now pursuing a master's degree and hoping to work in mental health, recalled his Shire work with ambivalence. He never lied or was told to lie, he said. He said he still would recommend Adderall XR and similar stimulants for A.D.H.D. children and adults.        \nWhat he regrets, he said, â€œis how we sold these pills like they were cars, when we knew they weren't just cars.â€        Selling to Parents        \nIn September 2005, over a cover that heralded Kirstie Alley's waistline and Matt Damon's engagement, subscribers to People magazine saw a wraparound advertisement for Adderall XR. A mother hugged her smiling child holding a sheet of paper with a â€œB+â€ written on it.        \nâ€œFinally!â€ she said. â€œSchoolwork that matches his intelligence.â€        \nWhen federal guidelines were loosened in the late 1990s to allow the marketing of controlled substances like stimulants directly to the public, pharmaceutical companies began targeting perhaps the most impressionable consumers of all: parents, specifically mothers.        \nA magazine ad for Concerta had a grateful mother saying, â€œBetter test scores at school, more chores done at home, an independence I try to encourage, a smile I can always count on.â€ A 2009 ad for Intuniv, Shire's nonstimulant treatment for A.D.H.D., showed a child in a monster suit taking off his hairy mask to reveal his adorable smiling self. â€œThere's a great kid in there,â€ the text read.        \nâ€œThere's no way in God's green earth we would ever promoteâ€ a controlled substance like Adderall directly to consumers, Mr. Griggs said as he was shown several advertisements. â€œYou're talking about a product that's having a major impact on brain chemistry. Parents are very susceptible to this type of stuff.â€        \nThe Food and Drug Administration has repeatedly instructed drug companies to withdraw such ads for being false and misleading, or exaggerating the effects of the medication. Many studies, often sponsored by pharmaceutical companies, have determined that untreated A.D.H.D. was associated with later-life problems. But no science determined that stimulant treatment has the overarching benefits suggested in those ads, the F.D.A. has pointed out in numerous warning letters to manufacturers since 2000.        \nShire agreed last February to pay $57.5 million in fines to resolve allegations of improper sales and advertising of several drugs, including Vyvanse, Adderall XR and Daytrana, a patch that delivers stimulant medication through the skin. Mr. Casola of Shire declined to comment on the settlement because it was not fully resolved.        \nHe added that the company's current promotional materials emphasize how its medications provide â€œsymptom controlâ€ rather than turn monsters into children who take out the garbage. He pointed to a Shire brochure and web page that more candidly than ever discuss side effects and the dangers of sharing medication with others.        \nHowever, many critics said that the most questionable advertising helped build a market that is now virtually self-sustaining. Drug companies also communicated with parents through sources who appeared independent, from support groups to teachers.        \nThe primary A.D.H.D. patient advocacy group, Children and Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, or Chadd, was founded in 1987 to gain greater respect for the condition and its treatment with Ritalin, the primary drug available at the time. Considerable funding was provided several years later by Ciba-Geigy Pharmaceuticals, Ritalin's primary manufacturer. Further drug company support helped create public service announcements and pamphlets, some of which tried to dispel concerns about Ritalin; one Chadd â€œfact sheetâ€ conflicted with 60 years of science in claiming, â€œPsychostimulant drugs are not addictive.â€                \nA 1995 documentary on PBS detailed how Chadd did not disclose its relationship with drug companies to either the Drug Enforcement Administration, which it was then lobbying to ease government regulation of stimulants, or the Department of Education, with which it collaborated on an A.D.H.D. educational video.        \nChadd subsequently became more open in disclosing its backers. The program for its 2000 annual convention, for example, thanked by name its 11 primary sponsors, all drug companies. According to Chadd records, Shire paid the group a total of $3 million from 2006 to 2009 to have Chadd's bimonthly magazine, Attention, distributed to doctors' offices nationwide.        \nChadd records show that the group has historically received about $1 million a year, one-third of its annual revenue, from pharmaceutical company grants and advertising. Regarding his company's support, Mr. Casola said, â€œI think it is fair to call it a marketing expense, but it's an arm's-length relationship.â€        \nâ€œWe don't control what they do,â€ he said. â€œWe do support them. We do support broadly what they are trying to do in the marketplace – in society maybe is a better way to say it.â€        Advocates Answer        \nThe chief executive of Chadd, Ruth Hughes, said in an interview that most disease-awareness groups receive similar pharmaceutical support. She said drug companies did not influence the group's positions and activities, and noted that Chadd receives about $800,000 a year from the C.D.C. as well.        \nâ€œOne pharma company wanted to get Chadd volunteers to work at their booth to sort of get peer counseling, and we said no, won't do that, not going there,â€ Dr. Hughes said, adding, â€œIt would be seen as an endorsement.â€        \nA.D.H.D. patient advocates often say that many parents resist having their child evaluated because of the stigma of mental illness and the perceived risks of medication. To combat this, groups have published lists of â€œFamous People With A.D.H.D.â€ to reassure parents of the good company their children could join with a diagnosis. One, in circulation since the mid-1990s and now posted on the psychcentral.com information portal beside two ads for Strattera, includes Thomas Edison, Abraham Lincoln, Galileo and Socrates.        \nThe idea of unleashing children's potential is attractive to teachers and school administrators, who can be lured by A.D.H.D. drugs' ability to subdue some of their most rambunctious and underachieving students. Some have provided parents with pamphlets to explain the disorder and the promise of stimulants.                \nSusan Parry, who raised three boys in a top public school system on Mercer Island, outside Seattle, in the 1990s, said teachers pushed her into having her feisty son Andy evaluated for A.D.H.D. She said one teacher told her that her own twins were thriving on Ritalin.        \nMrs. Parry still has the pamphlet given to her by the school psychologist, which states: â€œParents should be aware that these medicines do not ‘drug' or ‘alter' the brain of the child. They make the child ‘normal.' â€ She and her husband, Michael, put Andy on Ritalin. The Parrys later noticed that on the back of the pamphlet, in small type, was the logo of Ciba-Geigy. A school official told them in a letter, which they provided to The Times, that the materials had been given to the district by a Ciba representative.        \nâ€œThey couldn't advertise to the general public yet,â€ said Michael Parry, adding that his son never had A.D.H.D. and after three years was taken off Ritalin because of sleep problems and heart palpitations. â€œBut somebody came up with this idea, which was genius. I definitely felt seduced and enticed. I'd say baited.â€        \nAlthough proper A.D.H.D. diagnoses and medication have helped millions of children lead more productive lives, concerns remain that questionable diagnoses carry unappreciated costs.        \nâ€œThey were telling me, ‘Honey, there's something wrong with your brain and this little pill's going to fix everything,' â€ said Micaela Kimball, who received the diagnosis in 1997 as a high school freshman in Ithaca, N.Y., and is now a freelance writer in Boston. â€œIt changed my whole self-image, and it took me years to get out from under that.â€        \nToday, 1 in 7 children receives a diagnosis of the disorder by the age of 18. As these teenagers graduate into adulthood, drug companies are looking to keep their business.        The New Frontier: Adults        \nThe studio audience roared with excitement two years ago as Ty Pennington, host of â€œThe Revolutionâ€ on ABC, demonstrated how having adult A.D.H.D. felt to him. He staged two people struggling to play Ping-Pong with several balls at once while reciting the alphabet backward, as a  crowd clapped and laughed. Then things got serious.                \nA psychiatrist on the program said that â€œthe prison population is full of people with undiagnosed A.D.H.D.â€ He told viewers, â€œGo get this diagnosisâ€ so â€œyou can skyrocket.â€ He said that stimulant medication was effective and â€œsafer than aspirin.â€        \nNo one mentioned that Mr. Pennington had been a paid spokesman for Shire from 2006 to 2008. His Adderall XR video testimonials â€“ the medication â€œliterally changed my lifeâ€ and â€œgave me confidence,â€ he said in a 2008 ad – had drawn an F.D.A. reprimand for overstating Adderall's effects while omitting all risks.        \nMr. Pennington said through a spokeswoman: â€œI am not a medical expert. I am a television host.â€        \nMany experts agree that the disorder was dismissed for too long as affecting only children. Estimates of the prevalence of adult A.D.H.D. in the United States -- derived through research often backed by pharmaceutical companies -- have typically ranged from 3 to 5 percent. Given that adults far outnumber children, this suggests that the adult market could be twice as large.        \nBecause many doctors and potential patients did not think adults could have A.D.H.D., drug companies sold the concept of the disorder as much as their medications for it.                \nâ€œThe fastest-growing segment of the market now is the new adults who were never diagnosed,â€ Angus Russell told Bloomberg TV in 2011 when he was Shire's chief executive. Nearly 16 million prescriptions for A.D.H.D. medications were written for people ages 20 to 39 in 2012, close to triple the 5.6 million just five years before, according to IMS Health. No data show how many patients those prescriptions represent, but some experts have estimated two million.        \nForeseeing the market back in 2004, Shire sponsored a booklet that according to its cover would â€œhelp clinicians recognize and diagnose adults with A.D.H.D.â€ Its author was Dr. Dodson, who had delivered the presentation at the Adderall XR launch two years before. Rather than citing the widely accepted estimate of 3 to 5 percent, the booklet offered a much higher figure.        \nâ€œAbout 10 percent of adults have A.D.H.D., which means you're probably already treating patients with A.D.H.D. even though you don't know it,â€ the first paragraph ended. But the two studies cited for that 10 percent figure, from 1995 and 1996, involved only children; no credible national study before or since has estimated an adult prevalence as high as 10 percent.        \nDr. Dodson said he used the 10 percent figure because, despite several studies estimating adult rates as far lower, â€œonce a child has A.D.H.D., he does for life. It doesn't go away with age.â€        \nThe booklet later quotes a patient of his named Scarlett reassuring doctors: â€œIf you give me a drink or a drug, I'll abuse it, but not this medication. I don't consider it a drug. Drugs get abused. Medication helps people have satisfying lives.â€        \nShire's 2008 print campaign for adult A.D.H.D. portrayed a gloomy future to prospective patients. One ad showed a happy couple's wedding photo with the bride airbrushed out and â€œDIVORCEDâ€ stamped on it. â€œThe consequences may be serious,â€ the ad said, citing a study by Dr. Biederman supported in part by Shire. Although Dr. Biederman's study showed a higher rate of divorce among adults with the disorder, it did not assess whether stimulant treatment significantly deterred such consequences.        Questionable Quizzes        \nAdults searching for information on A.D.H.D. encounter websites with short quizzes that can encourage normal people to think they might have it. Many such tests are sponsored by drug companies in ways hidden or easily missed.        \nâ€œCould you have A.D.H.D.?â€ beckons one quiz, sponsored by Shire, on the website everydayhealth.com. Six questions ask how often someone has trouble in matters like â€œgetting things in order,â€ â€œremembering appointmentsâ€ or â€œgetting startedâ€ on projects.        \nA user who splits answers evenly between â€œrarelyâ€ and â€œsometimesâ€ receives the result â€œA.D.H.D. Possible.â€ Five answers of â€œsometimesâ€ and one â€œoftenâ€ tell the user, â€œA.D.H.D. May Be Likely.â€        \nIn a nationwide telephone poll conducted by The Times in early December, 1,106 adults took the quiz. Almost half scored in the range that would have told them A.D.H.D. may be possible or likely.        \nAbout 570,000 people took the EverydayHealth test after a 2011 advertisement starring Mr. Levine of Maroon 5 sponsored by Shire, Chadd and another advocacy group, according to the website Medical Marketing & Media. A similar test on the website for Concerta prompted L2ThinkTank.com, which assesses pharmaceutical marketing, to award the campaign its top rating, â€œGenius.â€        \nJohn Grohol, a Boston-area psychologist who licensed the test to EverydayHealth, said such screening tools do not make a diagnosis; they merely â€œgive you a little push into looking intoâ€ whether you have A.D.H.D. Other doctors countered that, given many studies showing that doctors are strongly influenced by their patients' image of what ails them, such tests invite too many patients and doctors to see the disorder where it is not.                \nâ€œI think it is misleading,â€ said Dr. Tyrone Williams, a psychiatrist in Cambridge, Mass. â€œI do think that there are some people out there who are really suffering and find out that maybe it's treatable. But these symptoms can be a bazillion things. Sometimes the answers are so simple and they don't require prescriptions â€“ like ‘How about eight hours of sleep, Mom, because four hours doesn't cut it?' And then all their A.D.H.D. symptoms magically disappear.â€        \nBecause studies have shown that A.D.H.D. can run in families, drug companies use the children's market to grow the adult one. A pamphlet published in 2008 by Janssen, Concerta's manufacturer – headlined â€œLike Parent, Like Child?â€ – claimed that â€œA.D.H.D. is a highly heritable disorderâ€ despite studies showing that the vast majority of parents of A.D.H.D. children do not qualify for a diagnosis themselves.        \nA current Shire manual for therapists illustrates the genetic issue with a family tree: three grandparents with the disorder, all six of their children with it, and seven of eight grandchildren, too.        \nInsurance plans, increasingly reluctant to pay for specialists like psychiatrists, are leaving many A.D.H.D. evaluations to primary-care physicians with little to no training in the disorder. If those doctors choose to learn about the diagnostic process, they can turn to web-based continuing-education courses, programs often subsidized by drug companies.        \nA recent course titled â€œUnmasking A.D.H.D. in Adults,â€ on the website Medscape and sponsored by Shire, featured an instructional video of a primary-care physician listening to a college professor detail his work-related sleep problems. After three minutes he described some attention issues he had as a child, then revealed that his son was recently found to have the disorder and was thriving in college on medication.        \nSix minutes into their encounter, the doctor said: â€œIf you have A.D.H.D., which I believe you do, family members often respond well to similar medications. Would you consider giving that a try?â€        \nThe psychiatrist who oversaw the course, Dr. David Goodman of Johns Hopkins and the Adult Attention Deficit Disorder Center of Maryland, said that he was paid several thousand dollars to oversee the course by Medscape, not Shire directly, and that such income did not influence his decisions with patients. But as he reviewed the video in September, Dr. Goodman reconsidered its message to untrained doctors about how quickly the disorder can be assessed and said, â€œThat was not an acceptable way to evaluate and conclude that the patient has A.D.H.D.â€        \nA Shire spokeswoman declined to comment on the video and the company's sponsorship of it.        \nMr. Casola said Shire remains committed to raising awareness of A.D.H.D. Shire spent $1 million in the first three quarters of 2013, according to company documents, to support A.D.H.D. conferences to educate doctors. One this autumn found  J. Russell Ramsay, a psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania's medical school, who also serves as a consultant and speaker for Shire, reading aloud one of his slides to the audience: â€œA.D.H.D. â€“ It's Everywhere You Want to Be.â€        \nâ€œWe are a commercial organization trying to bring health care treatments to patients,â€ Mr. Casola said. â€œI think, on balance, we are helping people.â€        \n         \n             \n      \nThis article has been revised to reflect the following correction:Correction: December 24, 2013An article on Dec. 15 about the pharmaceutical industry's two-decade influence on the rise in diagnoses of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and prescriptions for stimulants misstated the period during which the primary manufacturer of Ritalin, Ciba-Geigy Pharmaceuticals, provided funding to a patient advocacy group, Children and Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. It was several years after the group was founded; the money given was not â€œstart-up funding.â€\t\n\n",

      "title": "Spike in Harm to Liver Is Tied to Dietary Aids",
      "content": "\n\n\n\nWhen Christopher Herrera, 17, walked into the emergency room at Texas Children's Hospital one morning last year, his chest, face and eyes were bright yellow – â€œalmost highlighter yellow,â€ recalled Dr. Shreena S. Patel, the pediatric resident who treated him.         \n\n \nChristopher, a high school student from Katy, Tex., suffered severe liver damage after using a concentrated green tea extract he bought at a nutrition store as a â€œfat burningâ€ supplement. The damage was so extensive that he was put on the waiting list for a liver transplant.        \nâ€œIt was terrifying,â€ he said in an interview. â€œThey kept telling me they had the best surgeons, and they were trying to comfort me. But they were saying that I needed a new liver and that my body could reject it.â€        \nNew data suggests that his is not an isolated case. Dietary supplements account for nearly 20 percent of drug-related liver injuries that turn up in hospitals, up from 7 percent a decade ago, according to an analysis by a national network of liver specialists. The research included only the most severe cases of liver damage referred to a representative group of hospitals around the country, and the investigators said they were undercounting the actual number of cases.        \nWhile many patients recover once they stop taking the supplements and receive treatment, a few require liver transplants or die because of liver failure. NaÃ¯ve teenagers are not the only consumers at risk, the researchers said. Many are middle-aged women who turn to dietary supplements that promise to burn fat or speed up weight loss.        \nâ€œIt's really the Wild West,â€ said Dr. Herbert L. Bonkovsky, the director of the liver, digestive and metabolic disorders laboratory at Carolinas HealthCare System in Charlotte, N.C. â€œWhen people buy these dietary supplements, it's anybody's guess as to what they're getting.â€        \nThough doctors were able to save his liver, Christopher can no longer play sports, spend much time outdoors or exert himself, lest he strain the organ. He must make monthly visits to a doctor to assess his liver function.        \nAmericans spend an estimated $32 billion on dietary supplements every year, attracted by unproven claims that various pills and powders will help them lose weight, build muscle and fight off everything from colds to chronic illnesses. About half of Americans use dietary supplements, and most of them take more than one product at a time.        \nDr. Victor Navarro, the chairman of the hepatology division at Einstein Healthcare Network in Philadelphia, said that while liver injuries linked to supplements were alarming, he believed that a majority of supplements were generally safe. Most of the liver injuries tracked by a network of medical officials are caused by prescription drugs used to treat things like cancer, diabetes and heart disease, he said.        \nBut the supplement business is largely unregulated. In recent years, critics of the industry have called for measures that would force companies to prove that their products are safe, genuine and made in accordance with strict manufacturing standards before they reach the market.        \nBut a federal law enacted in 1994, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, prevents the Food and Drug Administration from approving or evaluating most supplements before they are sold. Usually the agency must wait until consumers are harmed before officials can remove products from stores. Because the supplement industry operates on the honor system, studies show, the market has been flooded with products that are adulterated, mislabeled or packaged in dosages that have not been studied for safety.        \nThe new research found that many of the products implicated in liver injuries were bodybuilding supplements spiked with unlisted steroids, and herbal pills and powders promising to increase energy and help consumers lose weight.        \nâ€œThere unfortunately are criminals that feel it's a business opportunity to spike some products and sell them as dietary supplements,â€ said Duffy MacKay, a spokesman for the Council for Responsible Nutrition, a supplement industry trade group. â€œIt's the fringe of the industry, but as you can see, it is affecting some consumers.â€ More popular supplements like vitamins, minerals, probiotics and fish oil had not been linked to â€œpatterns of adverse effects,â€ he said.        \nThe F.D.A. estimates that 70 percent of dietary supplement companies are not following basic quality control standards that would help prevent adulteration of their products. Of about 55,000 supplements that are sold in the United States, only 170 – about 0.3 percent – have been studied closely enough to determine their common side effects, said Dr. Paul A. Offit, the chief of infectious diseases at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and an expert on dietary supplements.        \nâ€œWhen a product is regulated, you know the benefits and the risks and you can make an informed decision about whether or not to take it,â€ he said. â€œWith supplements, you don't have efficacy data and you don't have safety data, so it's just a black box.â€        \nSince 2008, the F.D.A. has been taking action against companies whose supplements are found to contain prescription drugs and controlled substances, said Daniel Fabricant, the director of the division of dietary supplement programs in the agency's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. For example, the agency recently took steps to remove one â€œfat burningâ€ product from shelves, OxyElite Pro, that was linked to one death and dozens of cases of hepatitis and liver injury in Hawaii and other states.        \nThe new research, presented last month at a conference in Washington, was produced by the Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network, which was established by the National Institutes of Health to track patients who suffer liver damage from certain drugs and alternative medicines. It includes doctors at eight major hospitals throughout the country.        \nThe investigators looked at 845 patients with severe, drug-induced liver damage who were treated at hospitals in the network from 2004 to 2012. It focused only on cases where the investigators ruled out other causes and blamed a drug or a supplement with a high degree of certainty.        \nWhen the network began tracking liver injuries in 2004, supplements accounted for 7 percent of the 115 severe cases. But the percentage has steadily risen, reaching 20 percent of the 313 cases recorded from 2010 to 2012.        \nThose patients included dozens of young men who were sickened by bodybuilding supplements. The patients all fit a similar profile, said Dr. Navarro, an investigator with the network.        \nâ€œThey become very jaundiced for long periods of time,â€ he said. â€œThey itch really badly, to the point where they can't sleep. They lose weight. They lose work. I had one patient who was jaundiced for six months.â€        \nTests showed that a third of the implicated products contained steroids not listed on their labels.        \nA second trend emerged when Dr. Navarro and his colleagues studied 85 patients with liver injuries linked to herbal pills and powders. Two-thirds were middle-aged women, on average 48 years old, who often used the supplements to lose weight or increase energy. Nearly a dozen of those patients required liver transplants, and three died.        \nIt was not always clear what the underlying causes of injury were in those cases, in part because patients frequently combined multiple supplements and used products with up to 30 ingredients, said Dr. Bonkovsky, an investigator with the network.        \nBut one product that patients used frequently was green tea extract, which contains catechins, a group of potent antioxidants that reputedly increase metabolism. The extracts are often marketed as fat burners, and catechins are often added to weight-loss products and energy boosters. Most green tea pills are highly concentrated, containing many times the amount of catechins found in a single cup of green tea, Dr. Bonkovsky said. In high doses, catechins can be toxic to the liver, he said, and a small percentage of people appear to be particularly susceptible.        \nBut liver injuries attributed to herbal supplements are more likely to be severe and to result in liver transplants, Dr. Navarro said. And unlike prescription drugs, which are tightly regulated, dietary supplements typically carry no information about side effects. Consumers assume they have been studied and tested, Dr. Bonkovsky said. But that is rarely the case. â€œThere is this belief that if something is natural, then it must be safe and it must be good,â€ he said.        \n         \n             \n      \n\n",

      "title": "A Formula for Happiness",
      "content": "\n\n\n\nHAPPINESS has traditionally been considered an elusive and evanescent thing. To some, even trying to achieve it is an exercise in futility. It has been said that â€œhappiness is as a butterfly which, when pursued, is always beyond our grasp, but which if you will sit down quietly, may alight upon you.â€         \n\n \nSocial scientists have caught the butterfly. After 40 years of research, they attribute happiness to three major sources: genes, events and values. Armed with this knowledge andÂ a few simple rules, we can improve our lives and the lives of those around us. We can even construct a system that fulfills our founders' promises and empowers all Americans to pursue happiness.        \nPsychologists and economists have studied happiness for decades. They begin simply enough – by asking people how happy they are.        \nThe richest data available to social scientists is the University of Chicago's General Social Survey, a survey of Americans conducted since 1972. This widely used resource is considered the scholarly gold standard for understanding social phenomena. The numbers on happiness from the survey are surprisingly consistent. Every other year for four decades, roughly a third of Americans have said they're â€œvery happy,â€ and about half report being â€œpretty happy.â€ Only about 10 to 15 percent typically say they're â€œnot too happy.â€ Psychologists have used sophisticated techniques to verify these responses, and such survey results have proved accurate.        \nBeneath these averages are some demographic differences. For many years, researchers found that women were happier than men, although recent studies contend that the gap has narrowed or may even have been reversed. Political junkies might be interested to learn that conservative women are particularly blissful: about 40 percent say they are very happy. That makes them slightly happier than conservative men and significantly happier than liberal women. The unhappiest of all are liberal men; only about a fifth consider themselves very happy.        \nBut even demographically identical people vary in their happiness. What explains this?        \nThe first answer involves our genes. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have tracked identical twins who were separated as infants and raised by separate families. As genetic carbon copies brought up in different environments, these twins are a social scientist's dream, helping us disentangle nature from nurture. These researchers found that we inherit a surprising proportion of our happiness at any given moment – around 48 percent. (Since I discovered this, I've been blaming my parents for my bad moods.)        \nIf about half of our happiness is hard-wired in our genes, what about the other half? It's tempting to assume that one-time events – like getting a dream job or an Ivy League acceptance letter – will permanently bring the happiness we seek. And studies suggest that isolated events do control a big fraction of our happiness – up to 40 percent at any given time.        \nBut while one-off events do govern a fair amount of our happiness, each event's impact proves remarkably short-lived. People assume that major changes like moving to California or getting a big raise will make them permanently better off. They won't. Huge goals may take years of hard work to meet, and the striving itself may be worthwhile, but the happiness they create dissipates after just a few months.        \nSo don't bet your well-being on big one-off events. The big brass ring is not the secret to lasting happiness.        \nTo review: About half of happiness is genetically determined. Up to an additional 40 percent comes from the things that have occurred in our recent past – but that won't last very long.        \nThat leaves just about 12 percent. That might not sound like much, but the good news is that we can bring that 12 percent under our control. It turns out that choosing to pursue four basic values of faith, family, community and work is the surest path to happiness, given that a certain percentage is genetic and not under our control in any way.        \nThe first three are fairly uncontroversial. Empirical evidence that faith, family and friendships increase happiness and meaning is hardly shocking. Few dying patients regret overinvesting in rich family lives, community ties and spiritual journeys.        \nWork, though, seems less intuitive. Popular culture insists our jobs are drudgery, and one survey recently made headlines by reporting that fewer than a third of American workers felt engaged; that is praised, encouraged, cared for and several other gauges seemingly aimed at measuring how transcendently fulfilled one is at work.        \nThose criteria are too high for most marriages, let alone jobs. What if we ask something simpler: â€œAll things considered, how satisfied are you with your job?â€ This simpler approach is more revealing because respondents apply their own standards. This is what the General Social Survey asks, and the results may surprise. More than 50 percent of Americans say they are â€œcompletely satisfiedâ€ or â€œvery satisfiedâ€ with their work. This rises to over 80 percent when we include â€œfairly satisfied.â€ This finding generally holds across income and education levels.        \n         \n             \n       1  2  3 Next Page >>\nArthur C.

More Photos >>\n\n\n   \n\n\n         \nMarielle Jan de Beur often catches the 6:27 a.m. train to Grand Central Terminal, waiting on the Westchester platform with a swarm of dark-suited men, and then walks 10 blocks to a Park Avenue office fronted by the fountain where Audrey Hepburn cavorted in â€œBreakfast at Tiffany's,â€ playing a woman scheming to marry a wealthy man.                \nBut when the elevator lets her off at Wells Fargo, she enters another zone, where the gender dynamic that has long underpinned the financial industry is quietly being challenged. Ms. Jan de Beur and some of her colleagues rely on support that growing numbers of women on Wall Street say is enabling them to compete with new intensity: a stay-at-home husband.        \nIn an industry still dominated by men with only a smattering of women in its highest ranks, these bankers make up a small but rapidly expanding group, benefiting from what they call a direct link between their ability to achieve and their husbands' willingness to handle domestic duties. The number of women in finance with stay-at-home spouses has climbed nearly tenfold since 1980, according to an analysis of census data, and some of the most successful women in the field are among them.        \nWhen Ms. Jan de Beur flew to Hong Kong last spring to persuade Asian investors to re-enter the bond market, her husband took their daughter to try on confirmation dresses. Her colleagues Allison Poliniak and Gina Martin Adams share a running commentary on their husbands' efforts in the kitchen. Nicole Black recently texted her husband, Drew Skinner, as she headed home after a long day of earnings calls. â€œYou want to hit the gym? Go for it,â€ he replied, agreeing to spend another hour with their two small sons.                \nâ€œWhile I was dating Drew and getting married and having kids, I've gone from vice president to director to managing director,â€ Ms. Black said.        \nThese marriages are Wall Street-specific experiments in money, work, family and power. In interviews, dozens of couples provided field notes on their findings.        \nMany discovered that even with babysitting and household help, the demands of working in finance made a two-career marriage impossible. The arrangement can be socially isolating, they said, leaving both partners out of a child-rearing world still full of â€œMommy and Meâ€ classes. The couples told of new questions of marital etiquette, like who makes the big financial decisions or buys the wife's jewelry when she makes upward of a million dollars a year and the husband earns little or nothing.        \nIt is not clear, however, if these couples are leaders in the march toward gender equality or examples of how little is shifting on Wall Street. The banks say they want to hire and retain more women.        \nBut the solution that turns out to work so well for these women is an inaccessible option for many others, since it requires one spouse to give up a career and the other to earn enough money to support the family. Rather than changing the culture of the banks, which promote policies on flexible hours and work life balance, these women say that to succeed they must give in to its sometimes brutal terms, from 4:45 a.m. wake-ups onward through days of ceaseless competition.                \nAlong the way, the couples have come to question just what is male behavior and female behavior, noting how quickly their preconceived notions dissolve once they depart from assigned roles. The men echo generations of housewives, voicing concern over a loss of earning power and car pool-induced torpor but also pride in their nurturing roles. The women describe themselves as competitive, tough and proud of every dollar they bring in.        \nâ€œWe're almost like an opposite '50s couple,â€ said Mr. Skinner, Nicole Black's husband. â€œI'm staying at home, I do the dishes, I do the laundry, I do everything the housewife does. I'm just a dude.â€        \nNot every marriage proceeds as smoothly. One female banker told colleagues that she recently became irritated with her husband, who works part time, telling him, â€œI wish I had a wife.â€        \nâ€œYou can get one when I can get one,â€ he replied.        Role Reversals        \nRye, N.Y., is not an obvious place to mount a stand against established social roles. The town, on the moneyed coast of Long Island Sound, has long been populated by bankers, including John J. Mack, the former chief executive of Morgan Stanley. The clubs at the end of Stuyvesant Avenue have dress codes and sports like lawn bowling, and despite high property taxes, the town has no school buses, a special torture for working parents.        \nBut even Rye has a set of bankers with stay-at-home husbands, among them Ms. Jan de Beur, an executive in Wells Fargo's research department, and her architect-turned-artist husband, Jim Langley.                \nWhen they married 13 years ago, some of Ms. Jan de Beur's male colleagues scoffed, suggesting that she would become useless in the workplace. Marriage turned out to be one of her better career moves. By the time she became pregnant, her husband was working extremely long hours for an architecture firm that was pressuring him to relocate, and he made less than half of what she did. The solution seemed obvious.        \nTen years later, the life they have put together feels comfortable and well ordered: two bright, talkative children, 10 and 7 years old; a white-clapboard house that feels more cozy than imposing; and time in a sunny third-floor studio for Mr. Langley, who keeps books of work by Andrew Wyeth and Winslow Homer on his shelves. He has moments of wonder with his children, like playing kickball during a summer rainfall and making anatomical sculptures from tree branches.        \nIn interviews, Ms. Jan de Beur, driven and precise, praised her husband's nurturing skills. Mr. Langley sounded proud if a bit taken aback by his wife's success. â€œI'm aware of how lucky I am,â€ he said.        \nStill, his wife, along with other women in the same situation, suspects that the arrangement is harder on the men. Some of Mr. Langley's peers say the chatter at backyard gatherings about bonuses can make them wince: If a half-million-dollar salary is considered unimpressive in some Wall Street circles, where does that leave them?        \nWhen people ask what he does, Mr. Langley could say artist – he gives the buildings and landscapes he paints expressive personalities of their own – but he has just begun trying to sell his work. Other fathers in similar situations say they often tell white lies: They are retired, they are consultants, they work at home.        \nMr. Langley generally goes with â€œstay-at-home dad.â€        \nâ€œThat's what I call myself,â€ he said over lunch at a restaurant in Rye, the other tables filled with groups of women. â€œI wouldn't say I like it.â€        \nWhat response does he get?        \nâ€œThere's usually a long pause,â€ he said.        Feeling Excluded                \nHalf a century ago, Betty Friedan wrote â€œThe Feminine Mystiqueâ€ not far from where some of the female bankers live today. Even though their husbands have had far different experiences and options than Ms. Friedan's frustrated 1960s housewives, they sometimes express similar sentiments.        \nSome wonder what has come of their education, confess that they do not know how to make their way back to work after what they had hoped would be a temporary break, or admit that they do not quite understand their wives' work. Others have turned themselves into eager helpmates, booking their spouses' massages and mastering complicated cooking techniques.        \nBut many of the wives say their husbands approach parenthood differently than women do. The stay-at-home mothers in Rye often congregate at spinning or yoga classes, but their male counterparts all seem to have a hobby involving a boat: sailing, building wood kayaks and, in Mr. Langley's case, depicting fishing dinghies and half-finished hulls in his paintings. Despite their wealth, the men seem largely resistant to relying on nannies and babysitters, facing down screaming toddlers and constant meal preparation with go-it-alone stoicism.        \nBrandee McHale, a managing director of Citigroup's charitable foundation, says her husband, a former Marine, does not multitask, noting that for him, â€œLaundry is an activity.â€ But she also appreciates that he will focus just as intently on tossing a football with their children.        \nA few women said that they resented the fact that their husbands did not cook or clean up, but that they had trouble telling them so, for fear that they would sound as if they were treating them like employees.                \nWhen Kristine Braden, also of Citigroup, was stationed in the Philippines, she knew that her husband was never going to devote himself to hosting parties for her clients or setting a perfect table, the way some wives of male bankers did. (The couple entertained at restaurants or at home together on weekends.) Few of the men are willing to take on corporate spouse duties, like attending or hosting Wall Street dinners with the alpha men who work at the banks.        \nThe husbands often feel excluded from the social infrastructure that women have built up over generations to make stay-at-home life more manageable and fun. (â€œYou want awkward? Try a swim play date,â€ one father said.) Every man interviewed said that many school notices, invitations and Girl Scout troop updates were still sent to their wives, a river they are constantly trying to divert.        \nWhen Ed Fassler, married to Marcie Fassler, a vice president of operations at PNC Financial Services in Pittsburgh, was helping out with a school wrapping paper sale, the mothers gathered to go over the order – and excluded him. â€œMy husband wouldn't be happy if you're in my house with us,â€ the organizer told him.        \nIn March, Mr. Langley is renting space to mount a show of his paintings, and his home studio is cluttered with canvases and taped-together snapshots of the local landscape. In a test run in September, he offered two paintings for sale at an art auction in town. It was a community charity event, the buyers friends from the neighborhood. When both pieces sold, the larger fetching $1,400, husband and wife both felt relief.        Maintaining Focus        \nIn search of remedies, four of JP Morgan Chase's top women decided to fan out across the country last summer to find out why too many women at the nation's largest bank, and across the industry, still seemed somewhat stuck in their ascent.        \nFor years, JP Morgan and other banks have tried recruitment and retention efforts aimed at women, including â€œspeed mentoringâ€ (Wells Fargo), wine tastings to get to know management (Morgan Stanley), efforts at hiring women who had taken time off to raise children (Goldman Sachs) and clubs for female bankers (Citigroup alone has 60).        \nWhen Diane Schumaker-Krieg, Ms. Black's and Ms. Jan de Beur's boss, worked at Credit Suisse years ago, the chief executive at the time, Mr. Mack, even flew her and other promising women to his home for a golf tutorial to help them network on the greens.                \nStill, women make up just 16 percent of bank executives, according to the consulting firm Catalyst, and only a tiny number run the huge revenue-generating businesses like investment banking and trading, barely a change from a generation before.        \nIn their meetings with 2,500 women at seven JP Morgan offices, the four executives – including Mary Callahan Erdoes, the chief executive of the bank's asset management division, and Marianne Lake, the chief financial officer – heard the same messages again and again.        \nFlex time allowing employees to work from home one or more days a week carried stigma, the women felt. Some said they were reluctant to chase promotions that could require moves upending their families. Many female bankers still quit after having children.        \nOne morning last month, around the time Ms. Lake was departing for a similar round of meetings in Asia, Ms. Black arrived at her cluttered desk at Wells Fargo's office in Charlotte, N.C., and slid on her headset to hear the latest Viacom earnings.        \nShe tapped out a message for institutional investors, dropped in on a morning meeting to brief salespeople and traders, wrote a memo to clients about why she was downgrading Cisco's debt, and gave a talk to the sales force on a new bond, all before the clock struck 9:30. During that sprint, she was focused entirely on her work.        \nMs. Black and others say that is the real gift of a stay-at-home spouse: avoiding domestic distractions and competing better against other bankers, many of them men with stay-at-home wives.                \nIf Ms. Black gets a call on Tuesday afternoon asking her to attend an out-of-town dinner the next night, she can go. Ms. Jan de Beur took two trips a week on average last spring. Candida P. Wolff, the head of global government affairs for Citigroup, often travels about one and a half weeks each month.        \nBeing the breadwinner often means being taken more seriously in the workplace, they have learned. When one former banker was interviewing at a private equity firm, she said her prospective employers wanted to know what her husband did and seemed pleased that he had a low-paying but flexible job and handled more parenting duties. It dawned on her that the presumption men had often benefited from – that they would not be diverted by household demands – was finally applying to her too.        \nOn the home front, the women cast the deciding votes on major financial decisions. â€œIt's not like when you and I were growing up and Dad made all the decisions, but I still control the purse strings,â€ Ms. Black said.                \nAt Wells Fargo's modernist tower on Park Avenue, Ms. Schumaker-Krieg, the global head of research, economics and strategy for the bank, is making new recommendations on how to retain and advance female employees. She has spent decades persuading women on her team not to quit, even when they are put on bed rest during pregnancy or give birth to a child with special needs. And she would like others in the industry to follow suit.        \nShe acknowledges that part of the problem is the fundamental nature of the business: the ceaseless race to score the big deals and anticipate market moves. Soon she will complete year-end tallies, ranking the research analysts, including Ms. Black and Ms. Jan de Beur, against their competitors and each other.        \nSome of the women with stay-at-home husbands are her top performers. When she calls those men â€œthe wind beneath our wings,â€ she sounds both kind and calculating; the more domestic responsibility the men are willing to assume, the more their wives can help the bank make money.        \nâ€œIt's easy to slide into irrelevance by backing off just a little,â€ she warned.                \n         \n             \n      \nHannah Fairfield contributed research.\t\n\n\n\n ",

      "title": "Mandela's Death Leaves South Africa Without Its Moral Center",
      "content": "\n\n\n\nJOHANNESBURG – Nelson Mandela, South Africa's first black president and an enduring icon of the struggle against racial oppression, died on Thursday, the government announced, leaving the nation without its moral center at a time of growing dissatisfaction with the country's leaders.         \n\n \nâ€œOur nation has lost its greatest son,â€ President Jacob Zuma said in a televised address late Thursday night, adding that Mr. Mandela had died at 8:50 p.m. local time. â€œHis tireless struggle for freedom earned him the respect of the world. His humility, his compassion and his humanity earned him their love.â€        \nMr. Zuma called Mr. Mandela's death â€œthe moment of our deepest sorrow,â€ and said that South Africa's thoughts were now with the former president's family. â€œThey have sacrificed much and endured much so that our people could be free,â€ he said.        \nMr. Mandela spent 27 years in prison after being convicted of treason by the white minority government, only to forge a peaceful end to white rule by negotiating with his captors after his release in 1990. He led the African National Congress, long a banned liberation movement, to a resounding electoral victory in 1994, the first fully democratic election in the country's history.        \nMr. Mandela, who was 95, served just one term as South Africa's president and had not been seen in public since 2010, when the nation hosted the soccer World Cup. But his decades in prison and his insistence on forgiveness over vengeance made him a potent symbol of the struggle to end this country's brutally codified system of racial domination, and of the power of peaceful resolution in even the most intractable conflicts.        \nYears after he retreated from public life, his name still resonated as an emblem of his effort to transcend decades of racial division and create what South Africans called a Rainbow Nation.        \nâ€œHis commitment to transfer power and reconcile with those who jailed him set an example that all humanity should aspire to,â€ a grim President Obama said Thursday evening, describing Mr. Mandela as an â€œinfluential, courageous and profoundly goodâ€ man who inspired millions – including himself – to a spirit of reconciliation.        \nMr. Mandela and Mr. Obama both served as the first black leaders of their nations, and both men won the Nobel Peace Prize. But the American president has shied away from comparisons, often noting that his own sacrifices would never compare to the ones that Mr. Mandela endured.        \nMr. Obama said that the world would â€œnot likely see the likes of Nelson Mandela again,â€ and he noted that the former South African president had once said that he was â€œnot a saint, unless you think of a saint as a sinner who keeps on trying.â€        \nMr. Zuma did not announce the specific cause of Mr. Mandela's death, but he had battling pneumonia and other lung ailments for the past six months, and had been in and out of the hospital. Though his death was announced close to midnight, when most in this nation of early risers are asleep, a small crowd quickly gathered outside the house where he once lived in Soweto, on Vilekazi Street.        \nâ€œNelson Mandela, there is no one like you,â€ they sang, stamping their feet in unison to a praise song usually sung in joy. But in the midnight darkness, sadness tinged the melody.        \nâ€œHe was our father, our mother, our everything,â€ said Numfundo Matli, 28, a housekeeper who joined the impromptu celebration of Mr. Mandela's life. â€œWhat will we do without him?â€        \nHis death comes during a period of deep unease and painful self-examination for South Africa.        \nIn the past year and a half, the country has faced perhaps its most serious unrest since the end of apartheid, provoked by a wave of wildcat strikes by angry miners, a deadly response on the part of the police, a messy leadership struggle within the A.N.C. and the deepening fissures between South Africa's rulers and its impoverished masses.        \nScandals over corruption involving senior members of the party have fed a broader perception that Mr. Mandela's near saintly legacy from the years of struggle has been eroded by a more recent scramble for self-enrichment among a newer elite.        \nAfter spending decades in penurious exile, many political figures returned to find themselves at the center of a grab for power and money. Mr. Zuma himself was charged with corruption before rising to the presidency in 2009, though the charges were dropped on largely technical grounds. He has faced renewed scrutiny in the past year over $27 million spent in renovations to his house in rural Zululand.        \n         \n             \n       1  2 Next Page >>\nMichael D.

      "content": "\n\n\n\nThe year's best books, selected by the editors of The New York Times Book Review.         \n\n \nFICTION        \nAMERICANAHBy Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.Alfred A. Knopf, $26.95.        \nBy turns tender and trenchant, Adichie's third novel takes on the comedy and tragedy of American race relations from the perspective of a young Nigerian immigrant. From the office politics of a hair-braiding salon to the burden of memory, there's nothing too humble or daunting for this fearless writer, who is so attuned to the various worlds and shifting selves we inhabit – in life and online, in love, as agents and victims of history and the heroes of our own stories.        \nTHE FLAMETHROWERSBy Rachel Kushner.Scribner, $26.99.        \nRadical politics, avant-garde art and motorcycle racing all spring to life in Kushner's radiant novel of the 1970s, in which a young woman moves to New York to become an artist, only to wind up involved in the revolutionary protest movement that shook Italy in those years. The novel, Kushner's second, deploys mordant observations and chiseled sentences to explore how individuals are swept along by implacable social forces.        \nTHE GOLDFINCHBy Donna Tartt.Little, Brown & Company, $30.        \nTartt's intoxicating third novel, after â€œThe Secret Historyâ€ and â€œThe Little Friend,â€ follows the travails of Theo Decker, who emerges from a terrorist bombing motherless but in possession of a prized Dutch painting. Like the best of Dickens, the novel is packed with incident and populated with vivid characters. At its heart is the unwavering belief that come what may, art can save us by lifting us above ourselves.        \nLIFE AFTER LIFEBy Kate Atkinson.A Reagan Arthur Book/Little, Brown & Company, $27.99.        \nDemonstrating the agile style and theatrical bravado of her much-admired Jackson Brodie mystery novels, Atkinson takes on nothing less than the evils of mid-20th-century history and the nature of death as she moves back and forth in time, fitting together versions of a life story for a heroine who keeps dying, then being resurrected – and sent off in different, but entirely plausible, directions.        \nTENTH OF DECEMBERStoriesBy George Saunders.Random House, $26.        \nSaunders's wickedly entertaining stories veer from the deadpan to the flat-out demented: Prisoners are force-fed mood-altering drugs; ordinary saps cling to delusions of grandeur; third-world women, held aloft on surgical wire, become the latest in bourgeois lawn ornaments. Beneath the comedy, though, Saunders writes with profound empathy, and this impressive collection advances his abiding interest in questions of class, power and justice.        \nNONFICTION        \nAFTER THE MUSIC STOPPEDThe Financial Crisis, the Response, and the Work AheadBy Alan S. Blinder.The Penguin Press, $29.95.        \nBlinder's terrific book on the financial meltdown of 2008 argues that it happened because of a â€œperfect storm,â€ in which many unfortunate events occurred simultaneously, producing a far worse outcome than would have resulted from just a single cause. Blinder criticizes both the Bush and Obama administrations, especially for letting Lehman Brothers fail, but he also praises them for taking steps to save the country from falling into a serious depression. Their response to the near disaster, Blinder says, was far better than the public realizes.        \nDAYS OF FIREBush and Cheney in the White HouseBy Peter Baker.Doubleday, $35.        \nBaker succeeds in telling the story of the several crises of the Bush administration with fairness and balance, which is to say that he is sympathetic to his subjects, acknowledging their accomplishments but excusing none of their errors. Baker, the chief White House correspondent for The Times, is fascinated by the mystery of the Bush-Â­Cheney relationship, and even more so by the mystery of George W. Bush himself. Did Bush lead, or was he led by others? In the end, Baker concludes, the â€œdeciderâ€ really did decide.        \nFIVE DAYS AT MEMORIALLife and Death in a Storm-Ravaged HospitalBy Sheri Fink.Crown, $27.        \nIn harrowing detail, Fink describes the hellish days at a hospital during and after Hurricane Katrina, when desperate medical professionals were suspected of administering lethal injections to critically ill patients. Masterfully and compassionately reported and as gripping as a thriller, the book poses reverberating questions about end-of-life care, race discrimination in medicine and how individuals and institutions break down during disasters.        \nTHE SLEEPWALKERSHow Europe Went to War in 1914By Christopher Clark.Harper, $29.99.        \nClark manages in a single volume to provide a comprehensive, highly readable survey of the events leading up to World War I. He avoids singling out any one nation or leader as the guilty party. â€œThe outbreak of war,â€ he writes, â€œis not an Agatha Christie drama at the end of which we will discover the culprit standing over a corpse.â€ The participants were, in his term, â€œsleepwalkers,â€ not fanatics or murderers, and the war itself was a tragedy, not a crime.        \nWAVEBy Sonali Deraniyagala.Alfred A. Knopf, $24.        \nOn the day after Christmas in 2004, Deraniyagala called her husband to the window of their hotel room in Sri Lanka. â€œI want to show you something odd,â€ she said. The ocean looked foamy and closer than usual. Within moments, it was upon them. Deraniyagala lost her husband, her parents and two young sons to the Indian Ocean tsunami. Her survival was miraculous, and so too is this memoir – unsentimental, raggedly intimate, full of fury.        \n         \n             \n      \n\n",

      "title": "Baffling 400,000-Year-Old Clue to Human Origins",
      "content": "\n\n\n\nScientists have found the oldest DNA evidence yet of humans' biological history. But instead of neatly clarifying human evolution, the finding is adding new mysteries.         \n\n \nIn a paper in the journal Nature, scientists reported Wednesday that they had retrieved ancient human DNA from a fossil dating back about 400,000 years, shattering the previous record of 100,000 years.        \nThe fossil, a thigh bone found in Spain, had previously seemed to many experts to belong to a forerunner of Neanderthals. But its DNA tells a very different story. It most closely resembles DNA from an enigmatic lineage of humans known as Denisovans. Until now, Denisovans were known only from DNA retrieved from 80,000-year-old remains in Siberia, 4,000 miles east of where the new DNA was found.        \nThe mismatch between the anatomical and genetic evidence surprised the scientists, who are now rethinking human evolution over the past few hundred thousand years. It is possible, for example, that there are many extinct human populations that scientists have yet to discover. They might have interbred, swapping DNA. Scientists hope that further studies of extremely ancient human DNA will clarify the mystery.        \nâ€œRight now, we've basically generated a big question mark,â€ said Matthias Meyer, a geneticist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, and a co-author of the new study.        \nHints at new hidden complexities in the human story came from a 400,000-year-old femur found in a cave in Spain called Sima de los Huesos (â€œthe pit of bonesâ€ in Spanish). The scientific team used new methods to extract the ancient DNA from the fossil.        \nâ€œThis would not have been possible even a year ago,â€ said Juan Luis Arsuaga, a paleoanthropologist at Universidad Complutense de Madrid and a co-author of the paper.        \nFinding such ancient human DNA was a major advance, said David Reich, a geneticist at Harvard Medical School who was not involved in the research. â€œThat's an amazing, game-changing thing,â€ he said.        \nSince the 1970s, Spanish scientists have brought out a wealth of fossils from the cave dating back hundreds of thousands of years. â€œThe place is very special,â€ said Dr. Arsuaga, who has found 28 nearly complete skeletons of humans during three decades of excavations.        \nBased on the anatomy of the fossils, Dr. Arsuaga has argued that they belonged to ancestors of Neanderthals, which lived in western Asia and Europe from about 200,000 to 30,000 years ago.        \nWhen Dr. Meyer and his colleagues drilled into the femur, they found ancient human DNA inside, just as they had hoped.        \nâ€œOur expectation was that it would be a very early Neanderthal,â€ Dr. Meyer said.        \nBut the DNA did not match that of Neanderthals. Dr. Meyer then compared it to the DNA of the Denisovans, the ancient human lineage that he and his colleagues had discovered in Siberia in 2010. He was shocked to find that it was similar.        \nâ€œEverybody had a hard time believing it at first,â€ Dr. Meyer said. â€œSo we generated more and more data to nail it down.â€        \nThe extra research confirmed that the DNA belonged on the Denisovan branch of the human family tree.        \nThe new finding is hard to reconcile with the picture of human evolution that has been emerging based on fossils and ancient DNA. Denisovans were believed to be limited to East Asia, and they were not thought to look so Neanderthal-like.        \nBased on previously discovered ancient DNA and fossil evidence, scientists generally agreed that humans' direct ancestors shared a common ancestor with Neanderthals and Denisovans that lived about half a million years ago in Africa.        \nTheir shared ancestors split off from humans' lineage and left Africa, then split further into the Denisovans and Neanderthals about 300,000 years ago. The evidence suggested that Neanderthals headed west, toward Europe, and that the Denisovans moved east.        \nHumans' ancestors, meanwhile, stayed in Africa, giving rise to Homo sapiens about 200,000 years ago. Humans then expanded from Africa into Asia and Europe about 60,000 years ago. They then interbred not only with Neanderthals, but with Denisovans, too. Later, both the Denisovans and Neanderthals became extinct.        \nâ€œNow we have to rethink the whole story,â€ Dr. Arsuaga said.        \nDr. Arsuaga doubts that Denisovans were spread out across so much of the Old World, from Spain to Siberia, masquerading as Neanderthals.        \nOne alternative explanation is that the humans of Sima de los Huesos were not true Neanderthals, but belonged to the ancestors of both Denisovans and Neanderthals.        \nIt is also possible that the newly discovered DNA was passed to both Neanderthals and Denisovans, but eventually disappeared from Neanderthals, replaced by other variants.        \nâ€œIt got lost in one lineage but made its way in the other,â€ suggested Jean-Jacques Hublin, a Max Planck paleoanthropologist who was not involved in the research.        \nBeth Shapiro, an expert on ancient DNA at the University of California, Santa Cruz, favors an even more radical possibility: that the humans of Sima de los Huesos belong to yet another branch of humans. They might have been a species called Homo erectus, which originated about 1.8 million years ago and became extinct within the last few hundred thousand years.        \nâ€œThe more we learn from the DNA extracted from these fossils, the more complicated the story becomes,â€ Dr. Shapiro said.        \nThis complicated story has come to light only because of advances over the past 20 years in retrieving ancient DNA.        \nWhen an organism dies, its DNA breaks down into smaller and smaller fragments, while also becoming contaminated with the DNA of other species like soil bacteria. So piecing the fossil DNA together is a bit like putting together a jigsaw puzzle created by a sadist.        \nIn 1997, Svante Paabo of the Max Planck Institute and his colleagues, who had pioneered the techniques for retrieving DNA fragments, published a snippet of DNA from a Neanderthal fossil dating back about 40,000 years. They and other scientists then built on this success by searching for bits of DNA from other Neanderthals.        \nIn 2006, a team of French and Belgian researchers obtained a fragment of Neanderthal DNA dating back 100,000 years, which until now held the record for the oldest human DNA ever found.        \nMeanwhile, using improved methods, Dr. Paabo, Dr. Meyer and their colleagues assembled a rough draft of the entire Neanderthal genome in 2010.        \nThat discovery shed light on how Neanderthals and humans' ancestors split from a common ancestor hundreds of thousands of years ago. It also revealed that Neanderthals and humans interbred about 50,000 years ago.        \nAround the same time as that discovery, Russian collaborators sent the Max Planck team 80,000-year-old fossils they had found in a cave in Siberia called Denisova. When the German scientists sequenced the entire genome from the finger bone of a girl, it turned out to be neither human nor Neanderthal, but from a separate lineage, which Dr. Paabo and his colleagues named Denisovans.        \nDr. Meyer is hopeful that he and his colleagues will be able to get more DNA from the Spanish fossil, as well as other fossils from the site, to help solve the puzzle they have now stumbled across. â€œIt's extremely hard to make sense of,â€ Dr. Meyer said. â€œWe still are a bit lost here.â€        \n         \n             \n      \n\n",

      "title": "Who Says Math Has to Be Boring?",
      "content": "\n\n\n\nAmerican students are bored by math, science and engineering. They buy smartphones and tablets by the millions but don't pursue the skills necessary to build them. Engineers and physicists are often portrayed as clueless geeks on television, and despite the high pay and the importance of such jobs to the country's future, the vast majority of high school graduates don't want to go after them.         \n\n \nNearly 90 percent of high school graduates say they're not interested in a career or a college major involving science, technology, engineering or math, known collectively as STEM, according to a survey of more than a million students who take the ACT test. The number of students who want to pursue engineering or computer science jobs is actually falling, precipitously, at just the moment when the need for those workers is soaring. (Within five years, there will be 2.4 million STEM job openings.)        \nOne of the biggest reasons for that lack of interest is that students have been turned off to the subjects as they move from kindergarten to high school. Many are being taught by teachers who have no particular expertise in the subjects. They are following outdated curriculums and textbooks. They become convinced they're â€œno good at math,â€ that math and science are only for nerds, and fall behind.        \nThat's because the American system of teaching these subjects is broken. For all the reform campaigns over the years, most schools continue to teach math and science in an off-putting way that appeals only to the most fervent students. The mathematical sequence has changed little since the Sputnik era: arithmetic, pre-algebra, algebra, geometry, trigonometry and, for only 17 percent of students, calculus. Science is generally limited to the familiar trinity of biology, chemistry, physics and, occasionally, earth science.        \nThese pathways, as one report from the National Academy of Education put it, assume that high school students will continue to study science and math in college. But fewer than 13 percent do, usually the most well-prepared and persistent students, who often come from families where encouragement and enrichment are fundamental. The system is alienating and is leaving behind millions of other students, almost all of whom could benefit from real-world problem solving rather than traditional drills.        \nOnly 11 percent of the jobs in the STEM fields require high-level math, according to Anthony Carnevale, director of the Center on Education and the Workforce at Georgetown University. But the rest still require skills in critical thinking that most high school students aren't getting in the long march to calculus.        \nFinding ways to make math and science exciting for students who are in the middle of the pack could have a profound effect on their futures, providing them with the skills that will help them get technical jobs in the fields of food science, computer networking or medicine. It would entice many students who are insecure in their own abilities into advanced careers. But it is going to require a fundamentally different approach to teaching these subjects from childhood through high school. Here are a few of the many possible ideas to begin that change.        A More Flexible Curriculum        \nAmerican students need vastly improved skills in math and science – they ranked 30th among students in 65 nations in math – but they do not all have to be trained to be mathematicians or scientists. While all students need a strong grasp of the fundamentals of critical thinking and problem solving, including algebra and geometry, they should be offered a greater choice between applied skills and the more typical abstract courses.        \nThis is not an endorsement of tracking, the old practice of shunting some students into vocational classes while others are prepped for college. Every graduate should be ready for college (whether for a two- or four-year degree) but should also be exposed to the variety of skills that will be demanded as the country continues its shift to a post-industrial economy. As a study by the Georgetown center notes, very few high schools offer career or technical education; any deviation from a classical math education is viewed with suspicion.        \nResearch has shown that the right mix of career and technical education can reduce dropout rates, and the courses offered don't have to be from the old â€œindustrial artsâ€ ghettos. They should be taught at a challenging level and make students aware of careers that are now being ignored. Take engineering, for example, a field that pays well and needs ever more workers. Most high school students say they have no interest in the subject. That's largely because few of them ever encounter it: Only 3 percent of graduates have taken an engineering course. Only 19 percent of students have taken a computer science course, mostly at the advanced placement level.        \nThe Common Core math standards now being adopted by most states are an important effort to raise learning standards, particularly in primary and middle school, when many students begin to fall behind. They encourage the use of technology and applied thinking, moving students away from rote memorization. At the high school level, they would introduce all students to useful concepts like real-world modeling. But the standards also assume that all high school students should pursue a high-level math track, studying quadratic equations, transformational geometry and logarithms. The standards need more flexibility to ensure that they do not stand in the way of nontraditional but effective ways to learn, including career-oriented study.        Very Early Exposure to Numbers        \nOnly 18 percent of American adults can calculate how much a carpet will cost if they know the size of the room and the per square yard price of the carpet, according to a federal survey. One in five American adults lack the basic math skills expected of eighth graders, making them unfit for many newly created jobs. In many cases, that's because they weren't exposed to numbers at an early age.        \nA new study, by researchers at the University of Missouri, showed that the most important factor that predicted math success in middle school and upward was an understanding of what numbers are before entering the first grade. Having â€œnumber system knowledgeâ€ in kindergarten or earlier – grasping that a numeral represents a quantity, and understanding the relationships among numbers – was a more important factor in math success by seventh grade than intelligence, race or income.        \nChildren of all backgrounds can build a good foundation in math with early exposure to numbers, which should be required in all preschool classes. But less than half of 4-year-olds are enrolled in full-day pre-K programs, and only 70 percent of kindergartners go all day. Although preschool enrollment has increased in recent years, it is still not a high priority in many states and cities, as shown by the cold reception to expansion proposals by President Obama and Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio of New York.        Better Teacher Preparation        \nThe most effective teachers have broad knowledge of their subjects. Too many lack that preparation. More than half of the 6.7 million students studying physical sciences – chemistry, physics and earth science – are learning from teachers who did not major in those subjects. Only 64 percent of those teachers are certified. The number is better for math teachers, as 78 percent are certified, but that still leaves three million math students being taught by uncertified teachers. The problem is significantly worse in low-income communities and in middle schools.        \nSome districts give additional instruction to science and math teachers, or team new teachers with more experienced colleagues. But the most important effort is the national campaign to add 100,000 STEM teachers by 2021. The Carnegie Corporation has led a coalition of businesses, universities and other institutions to make it happen at the ground level. The American Museum of Natural History, for example, has pledged to prepare 130 certified science teachers by 2015. The University of Chicago will train 500 new teachers for Chicago's public schools over five years. The campaign now has commitments for more than 37,000 new teachers, but it still has far to go.        Experience in the Real World        \nA growing number of schools are helping students embrace STEM courses by linking them to potential employers and careers, taking math and science out of textbooks and into their lives. The high school in Brooklyn known as P-Tech, which President Obama recently visited, is a collaboration of the New York City public school system and the City University of New York with IBM. It prepares students for jobs like manufacturing technician and software specialist. Students work with IBM mentors and are encouraged to earn both a diploma and an associate degree after a combined six years in high school and college. Ten more such schools are planned around the state, and last month President Obama announced a promising new grant program to encourage dozens more high schools to offer job-oriented STEM education.        \nIn Seattle, Raisbeck Aviation High School is working with Boeing and other aerospace firms to mentor students in engineering and robotics. Many schools are teaming with software companies to teach programming, including two schools that are very popular in New York City. Though many of these efforts remain untested, they center around a practical and achievable goal: getting students excited about science and mathematics, the first step to improving their performance and helping them discover a career.                \n         \n             \n      \nThis article has been revised to reflect the following correction:Correction: December 9, 2013An earlier version of this editorial referred impreciselyÂ to a unit of measurement in a math problem.

      "title": "Common Knee Surgery Does Very Little for Some, Study Suggests",
      "content": "\n\n\n\nA popular surgical procedure worked no better than fake operations in helping people with one type of common knee problem, suggesting that thousands of people may be undergoing unnecessary surgery, a new study in The New England Journal of Medicine reports.         \n\n \nThe unusual study involved people with a torn meniscus, crescent-shaped cartilage that helps cushion and stabilize knees. Arthroscopic surgery on the meniscus is the most common orthopedic procedure in the United States, performed, the study said, about 700,000 times a year at an estimated cost of $4 billion.        \nThe study, conducted in Finland, involved a small subset of meniscal tears. But experts, including some orthopedic surgeons, said the study added to other recent research suggesting that meniscal surgery should be aimed at a narrower group of patients; that for many, options like physical therapy may be as good.        \nThe surgery, arthroscopic partial meniscectomy, involves small incisions. They are to accommodate the arthroscope, which allows doctors to see inside, and for tools to trim torn meniscus and to smooth ragged edges of what remains.        \nThe Finnish study does not indicate that surgery never helps; there is consensus that it should be performed in some circumstances, especially for younger patients and for tears from acute sports injuries. But about 80 percent of tears develop from wear and aging, and some researchers believe surgery in those cases should be significantly limited.        \nâ€œThose who do research have been gradually showing that this popular operation is not of very much value,â€ said Dr. David Felson, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at Boston University. This study â€œprovides information beautifully about whether the surgery that the orthopedist thinks he or she is doing is accomplishing anything. I think often the answer is no.â€        \nThe volunteer patients in the Finnish study all received anesthesia and incisions. But some received actual surgery, others simulated procedures. They did not know which.        \nA year later, most patients in both groups said their knees felt better, and the vast majority said they would choose the same method again, even if it was fake.        \nâ€œIt's a well-done study,â€ said Dr. David Jevsevar, chairman of the committee on evidence-based quality and value of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. â€œIt gives further credence or support to a number of studies that have shown that giving arthroscopy to patients is not always going to make a difference.â€        \nDr. Jevsevar, an orthopedic surgeon in St. George, Utah, said he hoped the study would spur research to better identify patients who should have surgery.        \nâ€œAre there operations that are done that do not need to be done? I'm sure that's the case, but we don't know the magnitude,â€ he said. â€œWe still think there's benefit in arthroscopic meniscectomy in appropriate patients. What we need to define in the future is what's the definition of appropriate patient.â€        \nOne factor is whether pain is caused by the torn meniscus or something else, especially osteoarthritis, which often accompanies tears. Another possible consideration is whether mechanical knee function is affected.        \nâ€œTake 100 people with knee pain; a very high percentage have a meniscal tear,â€ said Dr. Kenneth Fine, an orthopedic surgeon who also teaches at George Washington University. â€œPeople love concreteness: ‘There's a tear, you know. You have to take care of the tear.' I tell them, ‘No. 1, I'm not so sure the meniscal tear is causing your pain, and No. 2, even if it is, I'm not sure the surgery's going to take care of it.â€        \nDr. Fine added: â€œYours truly has a meniscal tear. It just causes pain. I'm not having any mechanical symptoms; my knees are not locking. So I'm not going to let anybody operate.â€        \nHe likened the recent studies to attempts to educate people that â€œit's not really good to take antibiotics for the common cold. There's a lot of pressure to operate. Financial, obviously. But also, if a primary care doctor keeps sending me patients who are complaining of knee pain and I keep not operating on them, then the primary care doctor is going to stop sending me patients.â€        \nThe new research builds on a groundbreaking 2002 Texas study, showing that patients receiving arthroscopy for knee osteoarthritis fared no better than those receiving sham surgery. A 2008 Canadian study found that patients undergoing surgery for knee arthritis did no better than those having physical therapy and taking medication. Now many surgeons have stopped operating on patients with only knee arthritis.        \nEarlier this year, a study at seven American hospitals found that patients with meniscal tears and osteoarthritis did not experience greater improvement with surgery than those receiving physical therapy, although after six months, one-third of the physical therapy group sought surgery. (Their surgical results were not reported.)        \nAn author of that study, Dr. Robert Marx of the Hospital for Special Surgery, said his conclusion was that often physical therapy should be tried before surgery. Still, â€œproperly selected patients do benefit from knee arthroscopy,â€ he said. â€œWhen you have someone who doesn't have arthritis and they have a painful meniscal tear, you're going to make that person very happy.â€        \nDr. Marx expressed some skepticism about the Finnish study, which involved patients with only meniscal tears, not perceptible arthritis. He wondered if the tears were small or if the pain was caused by the kneecap, adding, â€œI cannot believe that this would be the same population of patients I would operate on.â€        \nDr. Teppo Jarvinen, an author of the Finnish study, said whether meniscal tears caused the participants' pain was unknown, but arthritis was an unlikely cause, since they seemingly had none. About 10 percent of meniscal tear patients have no arthritis, he said.        \nThe study involved five hospitals and 146 patients, ages 35 to 65, with wear-induced tears and knee pain. About half had mechanical problems like locking or clicking knees.        \nMost patients received spinal anesthesia, remaining awake (one hospital used general anesthesia). Surgeons used arthroscopes to assess the knee. If it matched study criteria, nurses opened envelopes containing random assignments to actual or sham surgery. In real surgery, shaver tools trimmed torn meniscus; for fake surgery, bladeless shavers were rubbed against the outside of the kneecap to simulate that sensation. Nobody evaluating the patients later knew which procedure had been received.        \nAfter a year, each group reported similar improvement, even those with clicking or locking knees. Two in the surgery group needed further surgery; five in the sham group requested surgery. Dr. Jarvinen acknowledged the possibility that fake surgery had some placebo effect but said results were too strong for that to explain everything.        \nDr. Frederick Azar, first vice president of the orthopedic surgeons academy, said the study focused on a minority of patients, those he already did not operate on; he operates mostly on patients with mild to moderate arthritis whose meniscal tears appear to be causing pain.        \nâ€œArthroscopy is a very useful tool,â€ he said. Still, he said, â€œI'm sure there are some physicians who may look at this and say it may change the way they approach their patients, in terms of surgery or not surgery.â€        \n         \n             \n      \n\n",

      "title": "Why Other Countries Teach Better",
      "content": "\n\n\n\nMillions of laid-off American factory workers were the first to realize that they were competing against job seekers around the globe with comparable skills but far smaller paychecks. But a similar fate also awaits workers who aspire to high-skilled, high-paying jobs in engineering and technical fields unless this country learns to prepare them to compete for the challenging work that the new global economy requires.         \n\n \nThe American work force has some of the weakest mathematical and problem-solving skills in the developed world. In a recent survey by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a global policy organization, adults in the United States scored far below average and better than only two of 12 other developed comparison countries, Italy and Spain. Worse still, the United States is losing ground in worker training to countries in Europe and Asia whose schools are not just superior to ours but getting steadily better.        \nThe lessons from those high-performing countries can no longer be ignored by the United States if it hopes to remain competitive.        Finland: Teacher Training        \nThough it dropped several rankings in last year's tests, Finland has for years been in the highest global ranks in literacy and mathematical skills. The reason dates to the postwar period, when Finns first began to consider creating comprehensive schools that would provide a quality, high-level education for poor and wealthy alike. These schools stand out in several ways, providing daily hot meals; health and dental services; psychological counseling; and an array of services for families and children in need. None of the services are means tested. Moreover, all high school students must take one of the most rigorous required curriculums in the world, including physics, chemistry, biology, philosophy, music and at least two foreign languages.        \nBut the most important effort has been in the training of teachers, where the country leads most of the world, including the United States, thanks to a national decision made in 1979. The country decided to move preparation out of teachers' colleges and into the universities, where it became more rigorous. By professionalizing the teacher corps and raising its value in society, the Finns have made teaching the country's most popular occupation for the young. These programs recruit from the top quarter of the graduating high school class, demonstrating that such training has a prestige lacking in the United States. In 2010, for example, 6,600 applicants competed for 660 available primary school preparation slots in the eight Finnish universities that educate teachers.        \nThe teacher training system in this country is abysmal by comparison. A recent report by the National Council on Teacher Quality called teacher preparation programs â€œan industry of mediocrity,â€ rating only 10 percent of more than 1,200 of them as high quality. Most have low or no academic standards for entry. Admission requirements for teaching programs at the State University of New York were raised in September, but only a handful of other states have taken similar steps.        \nFinnish teachers are not drawn to the profession by money; they earn only slightly more than the national average salary. But their salaries go up by about a third in the first 15 years, several percentage points higher than those of their American counterparts. Finland also requires stronger academic credentials for its junior high and high school teachers and rewards them with higher salaries.        Canada: School funding        \nCanada also has a more rigorous and selective teacher preparation system than the United States, but the most striking difference between the countries is how they pay for their schools.        \nAmerican school districts rely far too heavily on property taxes, which means districts in wealthy areas bring in more money than those in poor ones. State tax money to make up the gap usually falls far short of the need in districts where poverty and other challenges are greatest.        \nAmericans tend to see such inequalities as the natural order of things. Canadians do not. In recent decades, for example, three of Canada's largest and best-performing provinces – Alberta, British Columbia and Ontario – have each addressed the inequity issue by moving to province-level funding formulas. As a recent report by the Center for American Progress notes, these formulas allow the provinces to determine how much money each district will receive, based on each district's size and needs. The systems even out the tax base and help ensure that resources are distributed equitably, not clustered in wealthy districts.        \nThese were not boutique experiments. The Ontario system has more than two million public school students – more than in 45 American states and the District of Columbia. But the contrast to the American system could not be more clear. Ontario, for example, strives to eliminate or at least minimize the funding inequality that would otherwise exist between poor and wealthy districts. In most American states, however, the wealthiest, highest-spending districts spend about twice as much per pupil as the lowest-spending districts, according to a federal advisory commission report. In some states, including California, the ratio is more than three to one.        \nThis has left 40 percent of American public school students in districts of â€œconcentrated student poverty,â€ the commission's report said.        Shanghai: Fighting Elitism        \nChina's educational system was largely destroyed during Mao Zedong's â€œcultural revolution,â€ which devalued intellectual pursuits and demonized academics. Since shortly after Mao's death in 1976, the country has been rebuilding its education system at lightning speed, led by Shanghai, the nation's largest and most internationalized city. Shanghai, of course, has powerful tools at its disposal, including the might of the authoritarian state and the nation's centuries-old reverence for scholarship and education. It has had little difficulty advancing a potent succession of reforms that allowed it to achieve universal enrollment rapidly. The real proof is that its students were first in the world in math, science and literacy on last year's international exams.        \nOne of its strengths is that the city has mainly moved away from an elitist system in which greater resources and elite instructors were given to favored schools, and toward a more egalitarian, neighborhood attendance system in which students of diverse backgrounds and abilities are educated under the same roof. The city has focused on bringing the once-shunned children of migrant workers into the school system. In the words of the O.E.C.D, Shanghai has embraced the notion that migrant children are also â€œour childrenâ€ – meaning that city's future depends in part on them and that they, too, should be included in the educational process. Shanghai has taken several approaches to repairing the disparity between strong schools and weak ones, as measured by infrastructure and educational quality. Some poor schools were closed, reorganized, or merged with higher-level schools. Money was transferred to poor, rural schools to construct new buildings or update old ones. Teachers were transferred from cities to rural areas and vice versa. Stronger urban schools were paired with rural schools with the aim of improving teaching methods. And under a more recent strategy, strong schools took over the administration of weak ones. The Chinese are betting that the ethos, management style and teaching used in the strong schools will be transferable.        \nAmerica's stature as an economic power is being threatened by societies above us and below us on the achievement scale. Wealthy nations with high-performing schools are consolidating their advantages and working hard to improve. At the same time, less-wealthy countries like Chile, Brazil, Indonesia and Peru, have made what the O.E.C.D. describes as â€œimpressive gains catching up from very low levels of performance.â€ In other words, if things remain as they are, countries that lag behind us will one day overtake us.        \nThe United States can either learn from its competitors abroad – and finally summon the will to make necessary policy changes – or fall further and further behind. The good news is that this country has an impressive history of school improvement, as reflected in the early-20th-century compulsory school movement and the postwar expansion, which broadened access to college. Similar levels of focus and effort will be needed to move forward again.                \n         \n             \n      \n\n",

      "title": "Nelson Mandela, South Africa's Liberator as Prisoner and President, Dies at 95",
      "content": "\n\n\n\nNelson Mandela, who led the emancipation of South Africa from white minority rule and served as his country's first black president, becoming an international emblem of dignity and forbearance, died Thursday night. He was 95.         \n\n \nThe South African president, Jacob Zuma, announced Mr. Mandela's death.        \nMr. Mandela had long said he wanted a quiet exit, but the time he spent in a Pretoria hospital this summer was a clamor of quarreling family, hungry news media, spotlight-seeking politicians and a national outpouring of affection and loss. The vigil eclipsed a visit by President Obama, who paid homage to Mr. Mandela but decided not to intrude on the privacy of a dying man he considered his hero.        \nMr. Mandela ultimately died at home at 8:50 p.m. local time, and he will be buried according to his wishes in the village of Qunu, where he grew up. The exhumed remains of three of his children were reinterred there in early July under a court order, resolving a family squabble that had played out in the news media.        \nMr. Mandela's quest for freedom took him from the court of tribal royalty to the liberation underground to a prison rock quarry to the presidential suite of Africa's richest country. And then, when his first term of office was up, unlike so many of the successful revolutionaries he regarded as kindred spirits, he declined a second term and cheerfully handed over power to an elected successor, the country still gnawed by crime, poverty, corruption and disease but a democracy, respected in the world and remarkably at peace.        \nThe question most often asked about Mr. Mandela was how, after whites had systematically humiliated his people, tortured and murdered many of his friends, and cast him into prison for 27 years, he could be so evidently free of spite.        \nThe government he formed when he finally won the chance was an improbable fusion of races and beliefs, including many of his former oppressors. When he became president, he invited one of his white wardens to the inauguration. Mr. Mandela overcame a personal mistrust bordering on loathing to share both power and a Nobel Peace Prize with the white president who preceded him, F. W. de Klerk.        \nAnd as president, from 1994 to 1999, he devoted much energy to moderating the bitterness of his black electorate and to reassuring whites with fears of vengeance.        \nThe explanation for his absence of rancor, at least in part, is that Mr. Mandela was that rarity among revolutionaries and moral dissidents: a capable statesman, comfortable with compromise and impatient with the doctrinaire.        \nWhen the question was put to Mr. Mandela in an interview for this obituary in 2007 – after such barbarous torment, how do you keep hatred in check? – his answer was almost dismissive: Hating clouds the mind. It gets in the way of strategy. Leaders cannot afford to hate.        \nExcept for a youthful flirtation with black nationalism, he seemed to have genuinely transcended the racial passions that tore at his country. Some who worked with him said this apparent magnanimity came easily to him because he always regarded himself as superior to his persecutors.        \nIn his five years as president, Mr. Mandela, though still a sainted figure abroad, lost some luster at home as he strained to hold together a divided populace and to turn a fractious liberation movement into a credible government.        \nSome blacks – including Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, Mr. Mandela's former wife, who cultivated a following among the most disaffected blacks – complained that he had moved too slowly to narrow the vast gulf between the impoverished black majority and the more prosperous white minority. Some whites said he had failed to control crime, corruption and cronyism. Some blacks deserted government to make money; some whites emigrated, taking capital and knowledge with them.        \nUndoubtedly Mr. Mandela had become less attentive to the details of governing, turning over the daily responsibilities to the deputy who would succeed him in 1999, Thabo Mbeki.        \nBut few among his countrymen doubted that without his patriarchal authority and political shrewdness, South Africa might well have descended into civil war long before it reached its imperfect state of democracy.        \nAfter leaving the presidency, Mr. Mandela brought that moral stature to bear elsewhere around the continent, as a peace broker and champion of greater outside investment.        \nRise of a ‘Troublemaker'        \n         \n             \n       1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 Next Page >>\nThis article has been revised to reflect the following correction:Correction: December 24, 2013An obituary on Dec. 6 about Nelson Mandela referred imprecisely to his educational background.

      "title": "Skip the Supplements",
      "content": "\n\n\n\nPHILADELPHIA – PARENTS whose children are admitted to our hospital occasionally bring along something extra to help with their care: dietary supplements, like St. John's wort to ameliorate mild depression or probiotics for better health.              \nHere's the problem: The Joint Commission, which is responsible for hospital accreditation in the United States, requires that dietary supplements be treated like drugs. It makes sense: Vitamins, amino acids, herbs, minerals and other botanicals have pharmacological effects. So they are drugs.        \nBut the Food and Drug Administration doesn't regulate dietary supplements as drugs – they aren't tested for safety and efficacy before they're sold. Many aren't made according to minimal standards of manufacturing (the F.D.A. has even found some of the facilities where supplements are made to be contaminated with rodent feces and urine). And many are mislabeled, accidentally or intentionally. They often aren't what they say they are. For example:        \nIn 2003, researchers tested â€œayurvedicâ€ remedies from health food stores throughout Boston. They found that 20 percent contained potentially harmful levels of lead, mercury or arsenic.        \nIn 2008, two products were pulled off the market because they were found to contain around 200 times more selenium (an element that some believe can help prevent cancer) than their labels said. People who ingested these products developed hair loss, muscle cramps, diarrhea, joint pain, fatigue and blisters.        \nLast summer, vitamins and minerals made by Purity First Health Products in Farmingdale, N.Y., were found to contain two powerful anabolic steroids. Some of the women who took them developed masculinizing symptoms like lower voices and fewer menstrual periods.        \nLast month, researchers in Ontario found that popular herbal products like those labeled St. John's wort and ginkgo biloba often contained completely different herbs or contaminants, some of which could be quite dangerous.        \nThe F.D.A. estimates that approximately 50,000 adverse reactions to dietary supplements occur every year. And yet few consumers know this.        \nParents of children admitted to our hospital often request that we continue treating their child with dietary supplements because they believe in them, even if that belief isn't supported by evidence. More disturbing were the times when children were taking these supplements without our knowledge. Doctors always ask parents if their children are taking any medicines. Unfortunately, because most parents don't consider dietary supplements to be drugs, we often never knew about their use, let alone whether they might react dangerously with the child's other treatments.        \nThe F.D.A. has the mandate, but not the manpower, to oversee the labeling and manufacture of these supplements. In the meantime, doctors – and consumers – are on their own.        \nOur hospital has acted to protect the safety of our patients. No longer will we administer dietary supplements unless the manufacturer provides a third-party written guarantee that the product is made under the F.D.A.'s â€œgood manufacturing practiceâ€ (G.M.P.) conditions, as well as a Certificate of Analysis (C.O.A.) assuring that what is written on the label is what's in the bottle.        \nThe good news is that we've been able to find some vitamins, amino acids, minerals and a handful of other supplements that meet this standard. For example, melatonin has been shown to affect sleep cycles and has a record of safety, and we identified a product that met manufacturing and labeling standards.        \nThe bad news is that this was a vanishingly small percentage of the total group. Around 90 percent of the companies we reached out to for verification never responded. They didn't call us back, or their email or manufacturing addresses changed overnight. Of the remainder, many manufacturers refused to provide us with either a statement of G.M.P. or a C.O.A.; in other words, they refused to guarantee that their products were what they said they were. Others lied; they said they met G.M.P. standards, but a call to the F.D.A. revealed they had been fined for violations multiple times. Perhaps most surprising, some manufacturers willingly furnished information that their product didn't meet standards – like one company that provided a C.O.A. showing that its product contained 47,000 International Units of beta-carotene, when the label stated 25,000.        \nNow, when parents in our hospital still want to use products whose quality can't be assured, we ask them to sign a waiver stating that the supplement may be dangerous, and that most have not been studied for their effectiveness. â€œUse of an agent for which there are no reliable data on toxicity and drug interactions,â€ the waiver reads, â€œmakes it impossible to adequately monitor the patient's acute condition or safely administer medications.â€        \nWhat can other individuals who are concerned about supplement safety do? They can look for â€œU.S.P. Verifiedâ€ on the label – this proves the supplement has been inspected and approved under the United States Pharmacopeial Convention. Unfortunately, fewer than 1 percent of the 55,000 or so supplements on the market bear this label. The real answer is that, until the day comes when medical studies prove that these supplements have legitimate benefits, and until the F.D.A. has the political backing and resources to regulate them like drugs, individuals should simply steer clear.        \nFor too long, too many people have believed that dietary supplements can only help and never hurt. Increasingly, it's clear that this belief is a false one.        \n         \n             \n      \nPaul A. Offit is chief of the division of infectious diseases at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, where Sarah Erush is the clinical manager in the pharmacy department.\t\n\n\n",

      "title": "Hypertension Guidelines Can Be Eased, Panel Says",
      "content": "\n\n\n\nNew guidelines suggest that people over 60 can have a higher blood pressure than previously recommended before starting treatment to lower it. The advice, criticized by some physicians, changes treatment goals that have been in place for more than 30 years.         \n\n \nUntil now, people were told to strive for blood pressures below 140/90, with some taking multiple drugs to achieve that goal. But the guidelines committee, which spent five years reviewing evidence, concluded that the goal for people over 60 should be a systolic pressure of less than 150. And the diastolic goal should remain less than 90.        \nSystolic blood pressure, the top number, indicates the pressure on blood vessels when the heart contracts. Diastolic, the bottom number, refers to pressure on blood vessels when the heart relaxes between beats.        \nEssentially, the committee determined that there was not strong evidence for the blood pressure targets that had been guiding treatment, and that there were risks associated with the medications used to bring pressures down.        \nThe committee, composed of 17 academics, was tasked with updating guidelines last re-examined a decade ago. Their report was published online on Wednesday in The Journal of the American Medical Association.        \nHypertension experts said they did not have a precise figure on how many Americans would be affected by the new guidelines. But Dr. William B. White, the president of the American Society of Hypertension, said it was â€œa huge number for sure.â€ He estimated that millions of people over 60 had blood pressures between 140 and 150. Dr. Paul A. James, the chairman of the department of family medicine at the University of Iowa and co-chairman of the guidelines committee, said, â€œIf you get patients' blood pressure below 150, I believe you are doing as well as can be done based on scientific evidence.â€        \nThe group added that people over 60 who are taking drugs and have lowered their blood pressure to below 150 can continue taking the medications if they are not experiencing side effects.        \nBut, it cautioned, although efforts to lower blood pressure have had a remarkable effect, reducing the incidence of strokes and heart disease, there is a difference between lowering blood pressure with drugs and having lower pressure naturally.        \nMedications that lower blood pressure can have effects that counteract some of the benefits, said Dr. Suzanne Oparil, a co-chairwoman of the committee and director of the vascular biology and hypertension program at the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine. For that reason, maximum benefits may occur with less intense treatment and higher blood pressure.        \nâ€œThe mantra of blood pressure experts in the past has been that lower is better,â€ Dr. Oparil said. â€œRecent studies don't seem to support that.â€        \nFor example, two Japanese studies in older people found that those who reduced their systolic pressure to less than 140 fared no better than those who reduced it to between 140 and 160, or between 140 and 149.        \nâ€œWe have this notion that if we can get blood pressure to normal, we will have the most health benefits,â€ Dr. James said. â€œThat's not necessarily true.â€        \nFor people younger than 60, the goal remains blood pressure under 140/90. The panel decided to keep that target because it could not find rigorous studies that established systolic blood pressure goals for younger people.        \nWhen blood pressure guidelines were first formulated in 1977, the committee only looked at diastolic pressure. â€œPeople thought systolic should be 100 plus your age,â€ Dr. Oparil said. â€œThat was old folk medicine.â€        \nObservational studies then found that systolic pressure was a better predictor of consequences like strokes. Researchers began to test the effects of lowering systolic blood pressure, but their studies excluded younger people because they were looking for outcomes, like strokes or heart failure, that are more common in older people. As a result, there are no good studies showing that younger people benefit from taking drugs to achieve a particular systolic pressure.        \n         \n             \n       1  2 Next Page >>\n\n",

      "title": "I Had My DNA Picture Taken, With Varying Results",
      "content": "\n\n\n\n I like to plan ahead; that much I knew about myself before I plunged into exploring my genetic code. I'm a healthy 28-year-old woman, but some nasty diseases run in my family: coronary heart disease, rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer's and breast cancer.         \n\n \nSo I decided to read the tea leaves of my DNA. I reasoned that it was worth learning painful information if it might help me avert future illness.        \nLike others, I turned to genetic testing, but I wondered if I could trust the nascent field to give me reliable results. In recent years, a handful of studies have found substantial variations in the risks for common diseases predicted by direct-to-consumer companies.        \nI set out to test the tests: Could three of them agree on me?        \nThe answers were eye-opening – and I received them just as one of the companies, 23andMe, received a stern warning from the Food and Drug Administration over concerns about the accuracy of its product. At a time when the future of such companies hangs in the balance, their ability to deliver standardized results remains dubious, with far-reaching implications for consumers.        \nMy experiment ran into hurdles from the start. After I ordered 23andMe's saliva test kit, which for $99 promised a report on more than 240 health conditions and traits, it turned out that I could not legally send it in; the New York State Health Department forbids any labs that lack a state permit to accept specimens from a health-related test. Luckily, my in-laws mailed it from their home in New Jersey.        \nThen I learned that the other two companies I planned to approach were no longer offering genetic testing. Additional research led me to two more: Genetic Testing Laboratories and Pathway Genomics. G.T.L. charged $285 for a report on 25 disease risks, and required a professional sample collector to draw blood; Pathway charged $399 for a report on 24 disease risks. (In 2010, Pathway planned to sell its saliva test kit at Walgreens, but abandoned the idea after the F.D.A. challenged the sales. Now Pathway requires a doctor to order a kit on a patient's behalf.)        \nAfter my tests had been sent, I braced myself for the revelations about my DNA. It took about two months to receive all the results, and when I did, the discrepancies were striking.        \n23andMe said my most elevated risks – about double the average for women of European ethnicity – were for psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, with my lifetime odds of getting the diseases at 20.2 percent and 8.2 percent. But according to Genetic Testing Laboratories, my lowest risks were for – you guessed it – psoriasis (2 percent) and rheumatoid arthritis (2.6 percent).        \nFor coronary heart disease, 23andMe and G.T.L. agreed that I had a close-to-average risk, at 26 to 29 percent, but Pathway listed my odds as â€œabove average.â€        \nIn the case of Type 2 diabetes, inconsistencies on a semantic level masked similarities in the numbers. G.T.L. said my risk was â€œmediumâ€ at 10.3 percent, but 23andMe said my risk was â€œdecreasedâ€ at 15.7 percent. In fact, both companies had calculated my odds to be roughly three-quarters of the average, but they used slightly different averages – and very different words – to interpret the numbers. In isolation, the first would have left me worried; the second, relieved.        \nMedical ethicists and other experts have a different kind of worry about results like these: a lack of industry standards for weighing risk factors and defining terminology.        \nâ€œThe ‘risk is in the eye of the beholder' standard is not going to work,â€ said Arthur L. Caplan, director of medical ethics at the New York University Langone Medical Center. â€œWe need to get some kind of agreement on what is high risk, medium risk and low risk.â€        \nSeveral other problems may account for my discrepancies. The genetic testing that these three companies offer is premised on reading segments of DNA called SNPs (pronounced snips), for single nucleotide polymorphisms. But these segments, which have been linked to diseases in research studies, vary among people.        \nScientists have identified about 10 million SNPs within our three billion nucleotides. But an entire genome sequencing – looking at all three billion nucleotides – would cost around $3,000; the tests I took examined fewer than a million SNPs.        \nâ€œImagine if you took a book and you only looked at the first letter of every other page,â€ said Dr. Robert Klitzman, a bioethicist and professor of clinical psychiatry at Columbia. (I am a graduate student there in his Master of Bioethics program.) â€œYou're missing 99.9 percent of the letters that make the genome. The information is going to be limited.â€        \nCompanies choose which SNPs to read. By comparing the technical reports provided with my results, I found that my tests sometimes relied on different SNPs to assess the same condition, like coronary heart disease. Each test studied four to 15 markers, with almost zero overlap, though two tests reached similar conclusions about my odds.        \nIn the case of rheumatoid arthritis, though, the tests examined the same five markers, plus a few others, and delivered contradictory interpretations.        \n         \n             \n       1  2 Next Page >>\n\n",

      "title": "Sustainable Resolutions for Your Diet",
      "content": "\n\n\n\nNew Year's resolutions tend to be big, impressive promises that we adhere to for short periods of time – that blissful stretch of January when we are starving ourselves, exercising daily and reading Proust. But, and you know this, rather than making extreme changes that last for days or weeks, we are better off with tiny ones lasting more or less forever.         \n\n \nMostly, though, when it comes to diet, we are told the opposite. We have a billion-dollar industry based on fad diets and quick fixes: Eat nothing but foam packing peanuts and lemon tea, and you'll lose 30 pounds in 30 days. Then what? Resolutions work only if we are resolute, and changes are meaningful only if they are permanent.        \nWhat follows are some of the easiest food-related resolutions you will ever make, from cooking big pots of grains and beans once a week, to buying frozen produce, to pickling things Ã  la â€œPortlandia.â€ Committing to just a few of these, or even one, will get you moving in the right direction toward eating more plants and fewer animal products and processed foods. My suggestions are incremental, but the ease with which you can incorporate them into your normal shopping, cooking and eating routines is exactly what makes them sustainable and powerful.        \nFlexitarianism is about making a gradual shift, not a complete overhaul. It is a way of eating we are much more likely to stick to for the long term – which, after all, is the point of resolutions in the first place.        \nCook simple, unseasoned vegetables every few days.        \nYou can steam or parboil or microwave. Once cooked, vegetables keep a long time. And then they're sitting there waiting to top pastas and grains, to bolster soups and salads, to whip up veggie wraps or just to reheat in oil or butter with seasonings.        \n Leftover vegetable spread. PurÃ©e any leftover vegetables (as long as they are tender) in the food processor with olive oil, fresh parsley leaves, lemon juice, salt and pepper until the mixture reaches the consistency you want. Serve with bread, crackers or cruditÃ©s. It's nice on toast as breakfast.        \nCook big batches of grains and beans.        \nBecause it's nearly effortless, and having cooked grains and beans on hand at all times makes day-to-day cooking a breeze. They will keep in the fridge up to a week.        \n White beans with kale and sausage. SautÃ© some loose Italian sausage in olive oil until lightly browned. Add minced garlic, cooked white beans, chopped kale, a splash of bean-cooking liquid or water, salt and pepper. Simmer until beans are hot and kale is wilted. To garnish, add oil and parsley.        \nBuy half as much meat, and make it better meat.        \nThinking of eating meat as an indulgence lets you buy tastier, healthier, more sustainable meat without breaking the bank.        \n Thai beef salad. Grill, broil or pan-sear a small piece of flank or skirt steak until medium-rare; set aside. Toss salad greens; plenty of mint, cilantro and basil; chopped cucumber; and thinly sliced red onion. Dress with a mixture of lime juice, fish sauce, sesame oil, sugar and minced jalapeÃ±o. Thinly slice the steak and lay it on top; drizzle with a little more dressing and any meat juices. Garnish with herbs.         \nSplurge when you can.        \nThat way, the foods you consider special treats are truly special. For me it's dark chocolate, meat and cheese.        \n Dark chocolate ganache. Heat 1 cup cream in a saucepan until steaming. Put 8 ounces chopped bittersweet chocolate in a bowl and pour the hot cream on top. Stir to melt and incorporate the chocolate; use immediately as a sauce, or cool to room temperature and whip to make a smooth frosting or filling.        \nBuy frozen fruits and vegetables.        \nBecause out-of-season produce from halfway around the world doesn't make much sense or taste best. Fruits and vegetables (from peaches, to corn, to squash) frozen when they are ripe are a better alternative, and incredibly convenient.        \n Frozen peach jam. Combine 1 pound frozen peaches, 1/4 cup sugar and 2 tablespoons lemon juice in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Bring to boil, then adjust heat so it bubbles steadily. Cook, stirring occasionally until thick, 15 to 30 minutes. Cool completely; it will keep in fridge at least a week.        \nPickle.        \nSo the copious amounts of fresh produce you buy never have to go to waste. And because it tastes good.        \n Quick-pickled cucumbers and radishes. Put thinly sliced cucumbers and radishes (use a mandoline if you have one) in a colander. Sprinkle with salt, gently rubbing it in with your hands. Let sit for 20 minutes, tossing and squeezing every few minutes. When little or no liquid comes out, rinse and put in a bowl. Toss with some sugar, dill and vinegar, and serve. Garnish with dill.         \nMake your own hummus, bean dips and nut butters.        \nWith those around, vegetables and fruit practically dip themselves. You'll be filling up on produce without even noticing it.        \nHummus. In a processor or blender, combine cooked chickpeas, minced garlic, tahini, lemon juice, olive oil, salt and pepper. PurÃ©e; taste and adjust the seasoning. Garnish with oil, lemon and smoked paprika.        \nMake your own condiments.        \nStore-bought versions of ketchup, barbecue sauce, salsa and the like are often loaded with preservatives and sugar. Besides, creating your own recipes is a blast.        \nMarjoram pesto. In a small food processor, combine a cup of marjoram (leaves and small stems) and some garlic; process until finely minced. Add red wine vinegar and olive oil; purÃ©e. Add capers (about a tablespoon) and pulse a few times. Season with salt and pepper to taste.        \nEat vegetables for breakfast.        \nYou already eat fruit for breakfast, so what's so strange? Veggie-based breakfasts are common around the world: cucumber and tomato salads in Israel, pickled vegetables in Japan, a bean and tomato stew in parts of Africa. Think of it as a trÃ¨s chic international trend.        \nCauliflower tabbouleh. Pulse cauliflower florets in a food processor, or chop them by hand, until they are small bits resembling grains. Toss with chopped tomatoes, plenty of chopped parsley and mint, lemon juice, olive oil, salt and pepper.         \nCook plants as you would meat.        \nBecause bold, meaty flavors aren't reserved just for flesh.        \nBreaded fried eggplant. Dredge 1/2-inch-thick eggplant slices in flour, then beaten egg, then bread crumbs. Put on a baking sheet lined with parchment and refrigerate at least 10 minutes (up to 3 hours). Shallow-fry (in batches, without crowding) in 1/4 inch olive oil in a large skillet until browned on both sides. Drain on paper towels. Garnish with parsley and lemon.Â         \nCooking for carnivores? Make extra sides.        \nLet the people around you have their fill of meat while you eat a bit, but fill up on vegetables, beans and grains.        \nRoasted broccoli gratin. Put broccoli florets in a baking dish; toss with olive oil, salt and pepper. Roast at 425 degrees until the tops are lightly browned and the stems nearly tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Sprinkle with bread crumbs (preferably homemade), mixed with Parmesan if you like, and a little more olive oil. Continue roasting until the bread crumbs are crisp.         \nCook out of your comfort zone.        \nBecause some of the best vegetable-centric food comes from halfway around the world, where it is â€œfood,â€ not â€œflexitarian.â€        \nCaramel-braised tofu. Put 1 cup sugar and 1 tablespoon water in a deep cast-iron skillet over medium heat; cook until sugar liquefies and bubbles. When it darkens, turn off the heat. Carefully pour in 1/2 cup fish sauce and 1/2 cup water; cook over medium-high heat, stirring, until it becomes liquid caramel. Add sliced shallots, cubed, pressed or extra-firm tofu, lots of black pepper and lime juice. Simmer, stirring occasionally until the tofu is hot.         \n         \n             \n      \n\n",

      "title": "Edward Snowden, Whistle-Blower",
      "content": "\n\n\n\nSeven months ago, the world began to learn the vast scope of the National Security Agency's reach into the lives of hundreds of millions of people in the United States and around the globe, as it collects information about their phone calls, their email messages, their friends and contacts, how they spend their days and where they spend their nights. The public learned in great detail how the agency has exceeded its mandate and abused its authority, prompting outrage at kitchen tables and at the desks of Congress, which may finally begin to limit these practices.         \n\n \nThe revelations have already prompted two federal judges to accuse the N.S.A. of violating the Constitution (although a third, unfortunately, found the dragnet surveillance to be legal). A panel appointed by President Obama issued a powerful indictment of the agency's invasions of privacy and called for a major overhaul of its operations.        \nAll of this is entirely because of information provided to journalists by Edward Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor who stole a trove of highly classified documents after he became disillusioned with the agency's voraciousness. Mr. Snowden is now living in Russia, on the run from American charges of espionage and theft, and he faces the prospect of spending the rest of his life looking over his shoulder.        \nConsidering the enormous value of the information he has revealed, and the abuses he has exposed, Mr. Snowden deserves better than a life of permanent exile, fear and flight. He may have committed a crime to do so, but he has done his country a great service. It is time for the United States to offer Mr. Snowden a plea bargain or some form of clemency that would allow him to return home, face at least substantially reduced punishment in light of his role as a whistle-blower, and have the hope of a life advocating for greater privacy and far stronger oversight of the runaway intelligence community.        \nâ€¢        \nMr. Snowden is currently charged in a criminal complaint with two violations of the Espionage Act involving unauthorized communication of classified information, and a charge of theft of government property. Those three charges carry prison sentences of 10 years each, and when the case is presented to a grand jury for indictment, the government is virtually certain to add more charges, probably adding up to a life sentence that Mr. Snowden is understandably trying to avoid.        \nThe president said in August that Mr. Snowden should come home to face those charges in court and suggested that if Mr. Snowden had wanted to avoid criminal charges he could have simply told his superiors about the abuses, acting, in other words, as a whistle-blower.        \nâ€œIf the concern was that somehow this was the only way to get this information out to the public, I signed an executive order well before Mr. Snowden leaked this information that provided whistle-blower protection to the intelligence community for the first time,â€ Mr. Obama said at a news conference. â€œSo there were other avenues available for somebody whose conscience was stirred and thought that they needed to question government actions.â€        \nIn fact, that executive order did not apply to contractors, only to intelligence employees, rendering its protections useless to Mr. Snowden. More important, Mr. Snowden told The Washington Post earlier this month that he did report his misgivings to two superiors at the agency, showing them the volume of data collected by the N.S.A., and that they took no action. (The N.S.A. says there is no evidence of this.) That's almost certainly because the agency and its leaders don't consider these collection programs to be an abuse and would never have acted on Mr. Snowden's concerns.        \nIn retrospect, Mr. Snowden was clearly justified in believing that the only way to blow the whistle on this kind of intelligence-gathering was to expose it to the public and let the resulting furor do the work his superiors would not. Beyond the mass collection of phone and Internet data, consider just a few of the violations he revealed or the legal actions he provoked:        \nâ–  The N.S.A. broke federal privacy laws, or exceeded its authority, thousands of times per year, according to the agency's own internal auditor.        \nâ–  The agency broke into the communications links of major data centers around the world, allowing it to spy on hundreds of millions of user accounts and infuriating the Internet companies that own the centers. Many of those companies are now scrambling to install systems that the N.S.A. cannot yet penetrate.        \nâ–  The N.S.A. systematically undermined the basic encryption systems of the Internet, making it impossible to know if sensitive banking or medical data is truly private, damaging businesses that depended on this trust.        \nâ–  His leaks revealed that James Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, lied to Congress when testifying in March that the N.S.A. was not collecting data on millions of Americans. (There has been no discussion of punishment for that lie.)        \nâ–  The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court rebuked the N.S.A. for repeatedly providing misleading information about its surveillance practices, according to a ruling made public because of the Snowden documents. One of the practices violated the Constitution, according to the chief judge of the court.        \nâ–  A federal district judge ruled earlier this month that the phone-records-collection program probably violates the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution. He called the program â€œalmost Orwellianâ€ and said there was no evidence that it stopped any imminent act of terror.        \nThe shrill brigade of his critics say Mr. Snowden has done profound damage to intelligence operations of the United States, but none has presented the slightest proof that his disclosures really hurt the nation's security. Many of the mass-collection programs Mr. Snowden exposed would work just as well if they were reduced in scope and brought under strict outside oversight, as the presidential panel recommended.        \nWhen someone reveals that government officials have routinely and deliberately broken the law, that person should not face life in prison at the hands of the same government. That's why Rick Ledgett, who leads the N.S.A.'s task force on the Snowden leaks, recently told CBS News that he would consider amnesty if Mr. Snowden would stop any additional leaks. And it's why President Obama should tell his aides to begin finding a way to end Mr. Snowden's vilification and give him an incentive to return home.        \n         \n             \n      \nMeet The New York Times's Editorial Board >>\t\n\n\n",
